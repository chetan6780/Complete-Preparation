# [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a `target` integer `target`, return a list of all **unique combinations** of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same number** may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is **guaranteed** that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.
