# Minimum number of platforms

Given the arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.

### Algorithm

1. Sort the arrival and departure times of trains.
2. Create two pointers i=1, and j=0 and a variable to store ans and current count platforms.
3. Run a loop while i<n and j<n and compare the ith element of arrival array and jth element of departure array.
4. If the arrival time is less than or equal to departure then one more platform is needed so increase the count, i.e. plat++ and increment i
5. Else if the arrival time greater than departure then one less platform is needed so decrease the count, i.e. platâ€“ and increment j
6. Update the ans, i.e ans = max(ans, plat).

### Code

```cpp

int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n)
{
    sort(arr, arr + n);
    sort(dep, dep + n);

    int pltNeeded = 1, result = 1;
    int i = 1, j = 0;

    while (i < n && j < n)
    {
        if (arr[i] <= dep[j])
        {
            pltNeeded++;
            i++;
        }
        else if (arr[i] > dep[j])
        {
            pltNeeded--;
            j++;
        }

        result = max(result, pltNeeded);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
space Complexity: O(1)
