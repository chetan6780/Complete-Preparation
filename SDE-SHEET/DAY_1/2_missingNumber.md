# [Repeating and missing number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-repeating-and-a-missing-number/) (MID)

Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array. Find these two numbers.

### O(N LogN) by sorting

- Sort the array
- Check if the number is repeated or missing

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space by Hashing

- Create a vector of size n and store the frequencies of each element in it.
- If frequency is 0 it is missing and if frequency is 2 it is repeated.

### O(N) Time Creating equations

- For 1st equation, We can take sum of n numbers by n\*(n+1)/2 and then subtract the sum of all the elements in the array.
- For 2nd equation, we can take sum of squares of n elements and subtract the sum of all the elements in the array.
- So we get `x - y = a1` and `x^2 - y^2 = a2` then we solve theses two equations and get `x + y = a3`.
- Then we solve `x + y = a3` and 'x - y = a1` to get x and y, Where **x=Missing and y=Repeated**.![tempSketch](https://i.imgur.com/5kRqcYN.png)
- **LIMITATION :** Since we are calculating sum of squares, it can exceed the range of int. So we need to use long long int.

### O(N) Time Using XOR
- XOR all the elements of array, store it in x.
- XOR all the elements till n, store it in y.
- When we XOR x and y we get `x^y = a`.
- All the bits that are set in a will be set in either x or y.
- divide the elements of the array in two sets one set of elements with same bit set and other set with same bit not set. 
- By doing so, we will get x in one set and y in another set.
- Now if we do XOR of all the elements in first set, we will get x, and by doing same in other set we will get y.
