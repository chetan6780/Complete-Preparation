# 1. Weird Algorithm

-   Just implementation.
-   NOTE: use long long int instead of int, since calculations can overflow.

# 2. Missing Number

-   Math based calculation.
-   res = sum of numbers till n - sum of given numbers.

# 3. Repetitions

-   Simple implementation.

# 4. Increasing Array

-   Make next number equal to current number if it is less than current number and add the difference to answer.

# 5. Permutations

-   For 1 ans is 1, for 2 to 4 there is no solution possible.
-   For rest print all even numbers first and then all odd numbers.

# 9. bit strings

-  There are 2^n bit strings of length n.
