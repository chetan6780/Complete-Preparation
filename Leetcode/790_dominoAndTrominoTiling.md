# [790. Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

### Dynamic Programming

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTilings(int n)
    {
        vector<long long int> dp(n + 1);
        iota(dp.begin(), dp.end(), 0); // iota- stores increasing numbers form val(here 0,1,2,3,...)
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 3]) % 1000000007;
        return dp.back();
    }
};
```
