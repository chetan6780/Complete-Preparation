# [1. Two Sum](./1_twoSum.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time Constant space

- Brute force - check every pair of numbers.

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

- The basic idea is to maintain a hash table for each element num in nums
- using num as key and its index (0-based) as value. For each num, search for target - num in the hash table.
- If it is found and is not the same element as num, then we are done.

# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./3_longestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^3) Time, O(N) space

- Brute force
- We can consider all substrings one by one and check for each substring whether it contains all unique characters or not.
- There will be n\*(n+1)/2 substrings.
- Whether a substring contains all unique characters or not can be checked in linear time by scanning it from left to right and keeping a map of visited characters.
- Time complexity of this solution would be O(n^3).

### O(N^2) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

- For every i in string we check, **How long the substring starting with index i have unique characters**

### O(N) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

- We keep track of unique characters in a hashmap(unordered_set).
- l is left index and r is right index, these indicates unique substring's start and end.
- if r'th character is not present in set, we add it and increment r also update `maxLength = max(maxLength, r-l);`
- if r'th character is present in set, we remove it from set and increment l pointer.
- finally return maxLength.

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity

- Get the length of the linked list.
- if n = length then return head->next
- n = length - n
- go to n-1th node then set its next to its next->next.
- delete the space of removed node, else it will cause memory leak.
- return head

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity, two pointers

- We take 2 pointers, fast and slow. (here both move equally i.e. 1 node at a time)
- move fast pointer n times.
- if fast is null return head->next
- now move slow and fast pointers together until fast->next != NULL.
- slow->next = slow->next->next
- Delete deleted node.
- **NOTE:** This method have same complexity as above method.

# [20. Valid Parentheses](./20_validParentheses.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space, straightforward solution

- if the string is empty, return true
- if the string has an odd number of characters, return false
- Create a stack to store parenthesis.
- if character is any opening parenthesis, push it to the stack
- after first if, if stack is empty, which means the character is closing parenthesis, return false
- else
  - current character is matching parenthesis of top char of stack, pop that opening character from stack.
  - else push it in the stack.
- return true if stack is empty else false.

### Some slight simplification

- we don't need to push extra closing parenthesis in the stack, if extra parenthesis appears return false.

# [155. Min Stack](./155_minStack.md) ðŸŒŸ

### TIP

- Solving a question to implement stack using stack is possible , but not a good idea.
- you can use 2 vector, 1 vector, vector of pair or map to implement the stack.

### Time Complexity: O(1) for all the solutions.

### Space Complexity: Extra O(N) Space used.

### Using 2 Vectors

- We maintain 2 vectors, 1 for stack implementation and another for min stack.push `INT_MAX` to min stack in declaration.
- `push` operation:
  - push element to stack.
  - push min element to min stack.
- `pop` operation:
  - pop element from stack.
  - pop min element from min stack.
- `top` operation:
  - return top element from stack.
- `getMin` operation:
  - return top element from min stack.

### Using 1 vector

- Instead of 2 vectors, we can use 1 vector to implement the stack.
- `push` operation:
  - if minElement is greater or equal to val, push minElement to stack and update minElement to val.
  - then push val in the stack.
- `pop` operation:
  - pop the top of the stack.
  - if top is equal to minElement, minElement will be top(next top) of the stack and pop the top(next top) from stack.

### Using vector of pair

- Self explanatory code

### O(log N \* log N) Time

- The idea behind the algorithm is - A complete binary tree has `2^h - 1` nodes, where `h` is the height of the tree.
- so we get the left and right hight of the tree.
- if the are equal, then we can directly return `2^(left) - 1`
- else we check for its right and left subtree and return `1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);`

---

# [226. Invert Binary Tree](./226_invertBinaryTree.md) ðŸŒŸ]

### O(N) Time recursive solution

# [542. 01 Matrix](./542_01Matrix.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### BFS solution

- Firstly, we can see that the distance of all zero-cells are 0.
- Same idea with Topology Sort, we process zero-cells first, then we use queue data structure to keep the order of processing cells, so that cells which have the smaller distance will be processed first. Then we expand the unprocessed neighbors of the current processing cell and push into our queue.
- After all, we can achieve the minimum distance of all cells in our matrix.

**Complexity:**

- Time: `O(M * N)`, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the matrix.
- Space: `O(M * N)`, space for the queue.

### DP Solution

- Firstly, we can see that the distance of all zero-cells are 0, so we skip zero-cells, we process one-cells only.
- In DP, we can only use previous values if they're already computed.
- In this problem, a cell has at most 4 neighbors that are left, top, right, bottom. If we use dynamic programming to compute the distance of the current cell based on 4 neighbors simultaneously, it's impossible because we are not sure if distance of neighboring cells is already computed or not.
- That's why, we need to compute the distance one by one:
  - Firstly, for a cell, we restrict it to only 2 directions which are left and top. Then we iterate cells from **top to bottom**, and from **left to right**, we calculate the distance of a cell **based on its left and top neighbors**.
  - Secondly, for a cell, we restrict it only have 2 directions which are right and bottom. Then we iterate cells from **bottom to top**, and from **right to left**, we update the distance of a cell **based on its right and bottom neighbors**.

**Complexity:**

- Time: `O(M * N)`, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the matrix.
- Space: `O(1)`

# [566. Reshape the Matrix](./566_reshapeMatrix.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N\*M) Time and O(N\*M)+O(N\*M) Space

- naive approach
- store 2D array in 1D temporary array.
- Create new r\*c matrix and fill it with the values from the temporary array.

### O(N\*M) Time and O(N\*M) Space (Row-First Approach

- M[i] => M[i/n][i%n] it will result in right mapping
- `i/c` will give us the row number of output matrix. We will move to New row after every c elements and thus dividing by c will give the row number.
- `i%c` will give us the column number of output matrix. We will be begin from start of new row after every c elements and this the remainder will give column of current row.
- The same happens in i/n and i%n but for the mat matrix).

# [617. Merge Two Binary Trees](./617_mergeTwoBinaryTrees.md) ðŸŒŸ

### DFS - Recursive

- if both nodes are null returns null.
- if one of the node null, return the other node.
- else Create new node with value = t1->val+t2->val.
- set new nodes left = merge(t1->left, t2->left)
- set new nodes right = merge(t1->right, t2->right)
- return new node;

**Time complexity**: **O(n)**. A total of n nodes need to be traversed. Here, n represents the minimum number of nodes from the two given trees.
**Space complexity**: **O(n)**. The depth of the recursion tree can go upto n in the case of a skewed tree. In average case, depth will be **O(log n)**.

### BFS - Iterative

- Base condition as in recursion
- Create 2 queues for BFS and push root nodes in them.
- While both queues are not empty
  - Store the front nodes and Pop from both queues
  - Add value of 2nd node in 1st
  - if node1's left is null and node2's left is not null, then add node1's left to node2's left
  - else if both's left not null then push them in respective queues
  - if node1's right is null and node2's right is not null, then add node1's right to node2's right
  - else if both's right not null then push them in respective queues.

**Time complexity**: **O(n)**. A total of n nodes need to be traversed. Here, n represents the minimum number of nodes from the two given trees.

# [653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST](./653_twoSumIV.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

- This method also works for those who are not BSTs.
- The idea is to use a hashtable to save the values of the nodes in the BST. Each time when we insert the value of a new node into the hashtable, we check if the hashtable contains k - node.val.

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

- The idea is to use a sorted array to save the values of the nodes in the BST by using an inorder traversal.
- Then, we use two pointers which begins from the start and end of the array to find if there is a sum k.

### O(hn) Time and O(h) space

- `h` is the height of the tree, which is `log n` at best case, and `n` at worst case.
- The idea is to use binary search method.
- For each node, we check if k - node.val exists in this BST.

# [695. Max Area of Island](./695_maxAreaOfIsland.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### DFS - Recursive

- For each cell we check, if it is 1, then we call a dsf on it

- **DFS Function:**

  - we pass grid, i and j in dfs.
  - if the cell is valid we call dfs on its four sides.

- **Complexity:**

  - Time: **O(M \* N)**, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the grid.
  - Space: **O(M \* N)**, the space used by the depth stack during our recursion, in worst case is **O(M \* N)**.

### BFS - Iterative

- For each cell we check, if it is 1,then we call a **bsf** on it

- **BFS Function**

  - We use q for bfs and push the first pair of i&j in q
  - While q is not empty
  - for top of the queue, we go on four directions and set `grid[nr][nc]=0` and increase the area count.
  - return the area.

- **Complexity:**

  - Time: **O(M \* N)**, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the grid.
  - Space: **O(M \* N)**, the space used by the queue in bfs, in worst case is **O(M \* N)**, can check this discussion:[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50912382/4084297)

### DFS - Recursive

- **Main function:**

  - if current color is not new color, call the dfs algorithm.
  - else return original image.

- **DFS function:**

  - check for invalid row and column numbers.
  - check if current color is not old color or is already new color.
  - for both the cases return.
  - set current color to new color.
  - call the function for all the 4 directions.

- **Complexity:**

  - Time: **O(M \* N)**, where `M <= 50` is number of rows, `N <= 50` is number of columns in the matrix.
  - Space: **O(M \* N)**, it's the depth stack memory, in worst case is **O(M \* N)**, can check this discussion on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50912382/4084297).

### BFS - Iterative

- **Main function:BFS**

  - if current color is already new color, return original image
  - We need a 2D direction vector and a queue for BFS (q of pairs).
  - push starting point in the queue.
  - while queue is not empty run loop.
    - get the row and column index form the front of the queue, and pop it.
    - set current color to new color
    - for all directions push {r,c} in the queue if it's valid.

# [1886. Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation](./1886_determineWhetherMatrixCanBeObtainedByRotation.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time solution

- Suppose we are at index i, j, let us find a relation of this position with it's position in various rotations. i. e

```
- 0 deg rotation : i, j will point to i, j
- 90 deg rotation : i, j will point to j, n - i - 1
- 180 deg rotation : i, j will point to n - i - 1, n - j - 1
- 270 deg rotation : i, j will point to n - j - 1, i
```

- We denote these rotations by boolean variables, initially we assume all these rotations are valid, so we set them all to true. Here

```
c[0] -> 0 deg rotation,
c[1] -> 90 deg,
c[2] -> 180 deg,
c[3] -> 270 deg
```

- Then, we loop over all elements and check if that particular rotation is valid or not. If not, we turn it to false.
- In the end, we simply check if any of the rotations is still possible or not.

# [1920. Build Array from Permutation](./1920_buildArrayFromPermutation.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space solution

- For i=0 to n , simply do what they have asked to.
- Push_back(nums[nums[i]])

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space optimization

- This is done to keep both old and new value together.
- going by the example of [5,0,1,2,3,4], n = 6(size of array)
- `nums[i] = nums[i]+(n*(nums[nums[i]]%n));`
- after this nums[0] will be 5 + 6\*(4%6) = 5 + 24 = 29;
- now for next index calculation we might need the original value of num[0] which can be obtain by num[0]%6 = 29%6 = 5;
- if we want to get just the new value of num[0], we can get it by num[0]/6 = 29/6 = 4
