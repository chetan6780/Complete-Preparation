# [1. Two Sum](./1_twoSum.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time Constant space

-   Brute force - check every pair of numbers.

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

-   The basic idea is to maintain a hash table for each element num in nums
-   using num as key and its index (0-based) as value. For each num, search for target - num in the hash table.
-   If it is found and is not the same element as num, then we are done.

# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./3_longestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^3) Time, O(N) space

-   Brute force
-   We can consider all substrings one by one and check for each substring whether it contains all unique characters or not.
-   There will be n\*(n+1)/2 substrings.
-   Whether a substring contains all unique characters or not can be checked in linear time by scanning it from left to right and keeping a map of visited characters.
-   Time complexity of this solution would be O(n^3).

### O(N^2) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

-   For every i in string we check, **How long the substring starting with index i have unique characters**

### O(N) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

-   We keep track of unique characters in a hashmap(unordered_set).
-   l is left index and r is right index, these indicates unique substring's start and end.
-   if r'th character is not present in set, we add it and increment r also update `maxLength = max(maxLength, r-l);`
-   if r'th character is present in set, we remove it from set and increment l pointer.
-   finally return maxLength.

# [15. 3Sum](./15_3sum.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^3 Log m) Brute force

-   Travel all the triplets which sums to 0.
-   Pseudo code

```
    for(i=0,n-1)
        for(j=i+1,n-1)
            for(k=j+1,n-1)
                a+b+c==0, cnt++
```

-   To get unique triplets, we can use set data structure.
-   N^3 for for loop and Log M for inserting unique triplets in the set.
-   **SC:** O(M), M is all unique triplets.

### O(N^2 Log M) Time and O(N)+O(M) Space

-   we can run 2 for loops for a and b.
-   store c in hashmap with its frequency
-   while running loops we have to decrease frequency of a and b inorder to find unique c.
-   then we find c=-(a+b) in the hashmap.
-   store the 3 numbers in sorted order in set so we will not have duplicates.
-   O(N^2) for 2 loops, Log(M) for inserting in set.
-   O(N) for map and O(M) For set.

### Two pointers.

-   Sort the array.
-   Fix a and you just need to find b+c=-a which is two sum problem.
-   To not get duplicates we increment pointer in such way that they are not equal to their previous values.
-   **TC:O(N\*N)**
-   **SC:O(M)**, M is the number of triplets.

# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](./19_removeNthNodeFromEndOfList.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity

-   Get the length of the linked list.
-   if n = length then return head->next
-   n = length - n
-   go to n-1th node then set its next to its next->next.
-   delete the space of removed node, else it will cause memory leak.
-   return head

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity, two pointers

-   We take 2 pointers, fast and slow. (here both move equally i.e. 1 node at a time)
-   move fast pointer n times.
-   if fast is null return head->next
-   now move slow and fast pointers together until fast->next != NULL.
-   slow->next = slow->next->next
-   Delete deleted node.
-   **NOTE:** This method have same complexity as above method.

# [20. Valid Parentheses](./20_validParentheses.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space, straightforward solution

-   if the string is empty, return true
-   if the string has an odd number of characters, return false
-   Create a stack to store parenthesis.
-   if character is any opening parenthesis, push it to the stack
-   after first if, if stack is empty, which means the character is closing parenthesis, return false
-   else
    -   current character is matching parenthesis of top char of stack, pop that opening character from stack.
    -   else push it in the stack.
-   return true if stack is empty else false.

### Some slight simplification

-   we don't need to push extra closing parenthesis in the stack, if extra parenthesis appears return false.

    -   move dummy pointer
-   if l2 is empty, add l1 to new list
-   if l1 is empty, add l2 to new list
-   Return next pointer of dummy node

### O(N+M) Time and O(1) space, in-place

-   if any list is empty, return the other list
-   l1 will always contain list of smaller value
    -   l1 will contain smaller val always;
    -   store l1 in result;
-   until any list is empty, run loop
    -   Create a temp node which points to nullptr
    -   while l1 has smaller element than l2, add l1 to temp
    -   after loop l2 will have smaller value than l1
    -   by swapping l1 and l2, l1 will contain smaller value
-   return final result which is pointer to l1 list

### O(N+M) Time and O(1) Space, Recursive

-   We will recursively join two linked list such that they will be always sorted.

### DP Solution(Tabulation)

-   We have base conditions of `dp[0] = dp[1] = 1.`
-   Then we calculate result for each number of nodes `i` from `2...n.`
-   For `i` nodes. we can consider each of the node `j` from `1...i` as the root node.
-   Considering the jth node as the root node in BST having total of `i` nodes, the result is summation for all `j` from `1...i` of `dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]`. (Comparing to above solution `dp[j-1] = numTrees(j-1) and dp[i-j]=numTrees(i-j)`)

# [101. Symmetric Tree](./101_symmetricTree.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time solution

-   we will traverse left and right subtrees of the root with the same type of traversal.
-   we compare the value of left with right or value of right with left , if they are not equal we return false.
-   we recurse for left's left with right's right and left's right with right's left.

### O(N) Time, using 2 queue, iterative solution

-   Same recursive solution can be converted to iterative solution by using queue.
-   Remember while using 2 queue we push `left->left,left->right` in 1st queue and `right->right,right->left` in 2nd queue.

### O(N) Time, using 1 queue, iterative solution

-   We can use 1 queue instead of 2.
-   remember that while using 1 queue we do `left->left,right->right,left->right,right->left.`

# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](./121_bestTimeToBuyAndSellStock.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time and O(1) Space

-   Brute force:
-   For each day, find the max profit that can be made by buying at that day and selling at the next j days.

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space

-   We try to sell stock each day.
-   For each day from last we store maximum stock price that will appear.
-   then for each day we calculate by selling the stock.

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space

-   We try to buy stock each day.
-   For each day we keep track of the minimum price of the stock that appeared before it.
-   if todays stock price is minimum we will update it.
-   return max profit.

### Optimized inner loop : 33% less time.

-   If the price of the stock that day less than minimum price so far then there is no chance to get profit so we only update minimum price.
-   else we can get profit, update maxProfit.

            profit += sell - buy;
        }
        return profit;

# [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](./129_sumRootToLeafNumbers.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time recursive

-   We recursively traverse to the all leaf node.
-   Multiply val by 10 and add curr val in it.
-   if both left and right child is null, we add the current node value to the sum.
-   else recurse for left anf right subtree.
-   Stack can grow upto the height of the tree so that we can explore the path from root to leaf node.
-   Thus, **Space Complexity = O(Height of the tree)**
-   **Time Complexity:O(N)** --> All Nodes will be visited once.

# [130. Surrounded Regions](./130_surroundedRegions.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### DFS Approach complex

-   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJViJEdtEc) explains both the approaches and code.
-   1st approach is complex while 2nd is easy.

### DFS Approach more efficient

-   Pick all O's from boundary (Top/Bottom row, Leftmost/Rightmost column)
-   Make all connected O's to some intermediate value (1 in my case).
-   Now remaining all O's are surrounded by X (otherwise they should have been converted to 1).
-   Convert remaining all O to X.
-   Revert all intermediate values. (1 to O).

-   **Time Complexity** - **O(m \* n)**
-   **Space Complexity** - **O(1)** if we ignore recursive stack calls else **O(m \* n)**

# [141. Linked List Cycle](./141_linkedListCycle.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

-   If there is a cycle in given linked list then same node must appear more than once.
-   so, we create an unordered_set of nodes ands while traversing the list we check if the node is already present in the linked list.
-   if its present we return true else we insert it into the unordered_set.
-   finally after completing loop we return false. because there is no cycle.

# [155. Min Stack](./155_minStack.md) ðŸŒŸ

### TIP

-   Solving a question to implement stack using stack is possible , but not a good idea.
-   you can use 2 vector, 1 vector, vector of pair or map to implement the stack.

### Time Complexity: O(1) for all the solutions.

### Space Complexity: Extra O(N) Space used.

### Using 2 Vectors

-   We maintain 2 vectors, 1 for stack implementation and another for min stack.push `INT_MAX` to min stack in declaration.
-   `push` operation:
    -   push element to stack.
    -   push min element to min stack.
-   `pop` operation:
    -   pop element from stack.
    -   pop min element from min stack.
-   `top` operation:
    -   return top element from stack.
-   `getMin` operation:
    -   return top element from min stack.

### Using 1 vector

-   Instead of 2 vectors, we can use 1 vector to implement the stack.
-   `push` operation:
    -   if minElement is greater or equal to val, push minElement to stack and update minElement to val.
    -   then push val in the stack.
-   `pop` operation:
    -   pop the top of the stack.
    -   if top is equal to minElement, minElement will be top(next top) of the stack and pop the top(next top) from stack.

### Using vector of pair

-   Self explanatory code

### O(NlogN) Time Sorting solution

-   First we sort the nums array.
-   if we found duplicates we increase i by 2 else we add number in ans.
-   if ans.size()==2 thn we can break loop, since we have only 2 unique elements.

### O(N) Time HashMap solution

-   We can use `set` or `map` to solve this problem in O(N) time.

### O(N) Time O(1) Bit Manipulation solution

Idea is to use property of XOR:

```
1. xor(a, a) = 0
2. xor(a, 0) = xor(0, a) = a
3. xor(1, 1) = xor(0, 0) = 0
4. xor(1, 0) = xor(0, 1) = 1
5. xor(a, b) = c => xor(a, c) = b and xor(b, c) = a
```

Let two distinct elements be: first and sec. Now, firstXorSec := xor(first, sec) = xor(nums[i], 0), 0 <= i < [n:= nums.size()], why? because nums has odd and even freq. elements, doing xor will cancel out elements with even freq. using the 1. property of xor. So, at the end, xor of only odd freq. elements i.e first and sec remains.

Now, first != sec => there is at least 1 set bit in firstXorSec. Using 4. property of xor, one of first and sec, must have a set bit (Let it be first). We find/ denote this rightmost set bit using mask: has all bits 0 except the rightmost set bit in firstXorSec. So, we can divide the elements in nums in two groups A and B, where:

```
1. groupA: (num & mask) == 1 i.e bit is set
2. groupB: (num & mask) == 0 i.e bit is not set
```

Clearly, both first and sec belong to different groups and since, all other elements occurs in pair, so, we can safely again use 1. property of xor to generate first. Finally, using 5. property of xor, we have `sec = xor(firstXorSec, first)`

# [441. Arranging Coins](./441_arrangingCoins.md) ðŸŒŸ

-   We can just simulate the process of building the staircase.
-   Assume we have k as result, `1+2+...+i = N`, then `i*(i+1) = 2N => i^2 = N => i = sqrt(N)`
-   **Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))**

### Binary Search

-   The problem can be converted into - Find the maximum k such that `k*(k+1)/2 <= n`.
-   **Time Complexity: O(logN)**

### Math solution

-   As we know the number of coins in each staircase are forming an AP `Eg :- 1+2+3+...+a = n`
    Sum of all terms of AP :- `(1+a)a/2 = n`
    n is given to us in question, we have to find a
-   ```
    ===> a ^ 2 + a = 2 n
    ===> x ^ 2 + a + 1/4 = 2 n +1/4
    ===> (a + 1/2 ) ^ 2 = 2n + 1/4
    ===> (a + 0.5) = sqrt( 2n + 1/4 )
    ===> a = -0.5 + sqrt( 2n + 1/4 )
    ```
-   We have calculated the value of `a = -0.5 + sqrt( 2\*n + 1/4 )`
-   **Time Complexity: O(1)**

# [542. 01 Matrix](./542_01Matrix.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### BFS solution

-   Firstly, we can see that the distance of all zero-cells are 0.
-   Same idea with Topology Sort, we process zero-cells first, then we use queue data structure to keep the order of processing cells, so that cells which have the smaller distance will be processed first. Then we expand the unprocessed neighbors of the current processing cell and push into our queue.
-   After all, we can achieve the minimum distance of all cells in our matrix.

**Complexity:**

-   Time: `O(M * N)`, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the matrix.
-   Space: `O(M * N)`, space for the queue.

### DP Solution

-   Firstly, we can see that the distance of all zero-cells are 0, so we skip zero-cells, we process one-cells only.
-   In DP, we can only use previous values if they're already computed.
-   In this problem, a cell has at most 4 neighbors that are left, top, right, bottom. If we use dynamic programming to compute the distance of the current cell based on 4 neighbors simultaneously, it's impossible because we are not sure if distance of neighboring cells is already computed or not.
-   That's why, we need to compute the distance one by one:
    -   Firstly, for a cell, we restrict it to only 2 directions which are left and top. Then we iterate cells from **top to bottom**, and from **left to right**, we calculate the distance of a cell **based on its left and top neighbors**.
    -   Secondly, for a cell, we restrict it only have 2 directions which are right and bottom. Then we iterate cells from **bottom to top**, and from **right to left**, we update the distance of a cell **based on its right and bottom neighbors**.

**Complexity:**

-   Time: `O(M * N)`, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the matrix.
-   Space: `O(1)`

### DFS - Recursive

-   **Main function:**

    -   if current color is not new color, call the dfs algorithm.
    -   else return original image.

-   **DFS function:**

    -   check for invalid row and column numbers.
    -   check if current color is not old color or is already new color.
    -   for both the cases return.
    -   set current color to new color.
    -   call the function for all the 4 directions.

-   **Complexity:**

    -   Time: **O(M \* N)**, where `M <= 50` is number of rows, `N <= 50` is number of columns in the matrix.
    -   Space: **O(M \* N)**, it's the depth stack memory, in worst case is **O(M \* N)**, can check this discussion on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50912382/4084297).

### BFS - Iterative

-   **Main function:BFS**

    -   if current color is already new color, return original image
    -   We need a 2D direction vector and a queue for BFS (q of pairs).
    -   push starting point in the queue.
    -   while queue is not empty run loop.
        -   get the row and column index form the front of the queue, and pop it.
        -   set current color to new color
        -   for all directions push {r,c} in the queue if it's valid.

-   **Complexity:**

    -   Time: **O(M \* N)**, where `M <= 50` is number of rows, `N <= 50` is number of columns in the matrix.
    -   Space: **O(M \* N)**, it's the depth stack memory, in worst case is **O(M \* N)**, can check this discussion on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50912382/4084297).

# [1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle](./1178_numberOfValidWordsForEachPuzzle.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Bit masking with hashmap

-   We set all the bits of the corresponding indices of each letter, then we easily see if it's a submask.
-   we create a hashmap to keep the frequency of each mask, so that if we have two words with the same letter we will count both.
-   we iterate through the puzzles
-   We need to find all combinations of submasks to check. This is the faster than iterating through all the words because each puzzle is only 7 letters.
-   For that we just do (submask-1) & mask - we are turning off a bit by subtracting one which sets the lowest 1 to 0 and all 0s in the right to 1s, and then we do & with the original mask to get only the desired bits.

### Interview Tips

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-1</b></summary>
In a real interview, if you are unsure how to solve the problem, a good first step is to remain calm and reread the problem description looking for hidden clues.
  Also, remember to ask the interviewer about the problem constraints. The constraints are very important for solving problems as they can help us determine which data structures and algorithms can feasibly be used to solve the problem.
  However, if the interviewer chooses to deliberately hide the constraints, then they likely want you to find different methods under different assumed constraints. Although, on rare occasions, a problem may be too simple to provide constraints.
</details>

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-2</b></summary>
A constraint under `10` usually accepts a method with `N!` time complexity with respect to this constraint. Factorial time complexities can occur for operations like finding all permutations from a set or using brute-force to solve the traveling salesman problem.
  A constraint under `30` usually accepts a method with `2^N` time complexity at worst with respect to this constraint. Some examples include iterating over all combinations or subsets from a set or some brute-force solutions that use `DFS`.
  However, a solution with better time complexity can still exist even when the constraints are small. One should use the constraints to estimate the complexity of the worst acceptable solution, not the best solution.
</details>

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-3</b></summary>
When you still do not have any idea after rereading the problem, you can try a brute-force method that works but may have an unacceptable time complexity.
  Then you can either try to improve on the brute-force method or gain some insight from the brute-force method.
</details>

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-4</b></summary>
In an interview, if the first solution that comes to mind involves a complex data structure, you can wait a minute and try thinking of other similar methods. In a real-world setting, we typically prioritize efficiency and readability. We prioritize these characteristics in an interview setting as well, however, we also value solutions that we are less likely to make a mistake while coding and solutions that do not require a long time to code.
  In this problem, you should consider your level of familiarity with the trie data structure before choosing between implementing a solution using a trie or a set. If the more comfortable approach is not the most efficient, then you should also weigh the increased chance of making a mistake versus the gain of having a more efficient solution.
  Worry not, as we will cover both methods in this article.

# [1886. Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation](./1886_determineWhetherMatrixCanBeObtainedByRotation.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time solution

-   Suppose we are at index i, j, let us find a relation of this position with it's position in various rotations. i. e

```
- 0 deg rotation : i, j will point to i, j
- 90 deg rotation : i, j will point to j, n - i - 1
- 180 deg rotation : i, j will point to n - i - 1, n - j - 1
- 270 deg rotation : i, j will point to n - j - 1, i
```

-   We denote these rotations by boolean variables, initially we assume all these rotations are valid, so we set them all to true. Here

```
c[0] -> 0 deg rotation,
c[1] -> 90 deg,
c[2] -> 180 deg,
c[3] -> 270 deg
```

-   Then, we loop over all elements and check if that particular rotation is valid or not. If not, we turn it to false.
-   In the end, we simply check if any of the rotations is still possible or not.
