# [1. Two Sum](./1_twoSum.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time Constant space

- Brute force - check every pair of numbers.

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

- The basic idea is to maintain a hash table for each element num in nums
- using num as key and its index (0-based) as value. For each num, search for target - num in the hash table.
- If it is found and is not the same element as num, then we are done.

# [35. Search Insert Position](./searchInsertPosition.md)

### O(log N) Time solution

- Modification of BS.
- l<r
  - if target greater than element at mid.
    - l = mid+1
  - else
    - r = mid // not mid-1;
- return l

# [53. Maximum Subarray](./53_maximumSubarray.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) time constant space(DP)

- We maintain a maximum sum and current sum(if element itself is max)
- for each i=(0,n)
  - add current element to current sum
  - mx = max(current sum , mx);
  - current sum will be max(0,current sum);
- finally we return mx

# [1886. Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation](./1886_determineWhetherMatrixCanBeObtainedByRotation.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time solution

- Suppose we are at index i, j, let us find a relation of this position with it's position in various rotations. i. e

```
- 0 deg rotation : i, j will point to i, j
- 90 deg rotation : i, j will point to j, n - i - 1
- 180 deg rotation : i, j will point to n - i - 1, n - j - 1
- 270 deg rotation : i, j will point to n - j - 1, i
```

- We denote these rotations by boolean variables, initially we assume all these rotations are valid, so we set them all to true. Here

```
c[0] -> 0 deg rotation,
c[1] -> 90 deg,
c[2] -> 180 deg,
c[3] -> 270 deg
```

- Then, we loop over all elements and check if that particular rotation is valid or not. If not, we turn it to false.
- In the end, we simply check if any of the rotations is still possible or not.

# [1920. Build Array from Permutation](./1920_buildArrayFromPermutation.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space solution

- For i=0 to n , simply do what they have asked to.
- Push_back(nums[nums[i]])

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space optimization

- This is done to keep both old and new value together.
- going by the example of [5,0,1,2,3,4], n = 6(size of array)
- `nums[i] = nums[i]+(n*(nums[nums[i]]%n));`
- after this nums[0] will be 5 + 6\*(4%6) = 5 + 24 = 29;
- now for next index calulation we might need the original value of num[0] which can be obtain by num[0]%6 = 29%6 = 5;
- if we want to get just the new value of num[0], we can get it by num[0]/6 = 29/6 = 4
