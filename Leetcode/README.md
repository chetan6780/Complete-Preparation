### O(N^2) Time Constant space

-   Brute force - check every pair of numbers.

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

-   The basic idea is to maintain a hash table for each element num in nums
-   using num as key and its index (0-based) as value. For each num, search for target - num in the hash table.
-   If it is found and is not the same element as num, then we are done.

# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./3_longestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^3) Time, O(N) space

-   Brute force
-   We can consider all substrings one by one and check for each substring whether it contains all unique characters or not.
-   There will be n\*(n+1)/2 substrings.
-   Whether a substring contains all unique characters or not can be checked in linear time by scanning it from left to right and keeping a map of visited characters.
-   Time complexity of this solution would be O(n^3).

### O(N^2) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

-   For every i in string we check, **How long the substring starting with index i have unique characters**

### O(N) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

-   We keep track of unique characters in a hashmap(unordered_set).
-   l is left index and r is right index, these indicates unique substring's start and end.
-   if r'th character is not present in set, we add it and increment r also update `maxLength = max(maxLength, r-l);`
-   if r'th character is present in set, we remove it from set and increment l pointer.
-   finally return maxLength.

# [15. 3Sum](./15_3sum.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^3 Log m) Brute force

-   Travel all the triplets which sums to 0.
-   Pseudo code

```
    for(i=0,n-1)
        for(j=i+1,n-1)
            for(k=j+1,n-1)
                a+b+c==0, cnt++
```

-   To get unique triplets, we can use set data structure.
-   N^3 for for loop and Log M for inserting unique triplets in the set.
-   **SC:** O(M), M is all unique triplets.

### O(N^2 Log M) Time and O(N)+O(M) Space

-   we can run 2 for loops for a and b.
-   store c in hashmap with its frequency
-   while running loops we have to decrease frequency of a and b inorder to find unique c.
-   then we find c=-(a+b) in the hashmap.
-   store the 3 numbers in sorted order in set so we will not have duplicates.
-   O(N^2) for 2 loops, Log(M) for inserting in set.
-   O(N) for map and O(M) For set.

### Two pointers.

-   Sort the array.
-   Fix a and you just need to find b+c=-a which is two sum problem.
-   To not get duplicates we increment pointer in such way that they are not equal to their previous values.
-   **TC:O(N\*N)**
-   **SC:O(M)**, M is the number of triplets.

-   ```cpp
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    v.erase(unique(v.begin(), v.end()), v.end());
    ```
-   See my [GFG Solution](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-all-four-sum-numbers1732/1) for better understanding.

### Sort + 2ptr + BinarySearch

-   **TC: O(N^3)** - 2loops and finding 2 elements in O(N) time.
-   **SC: O(1)**
-   we keep i,j pointers and find l and r using binary search.
-   We can **overcome int overflow** by calculating target in every loop.(see code)
-   We can also overcome extra space by processing pointers until duplicates occurs.(see code)

# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](./19_removeNthNodeFromEndOfList.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity

-   Get the length of the linked list.
-   if n = length then return head->next
-   n = length - n
-   go to n-1th node then set its next to its next->next.
-   delete the space of removed node, else it will cause memory leak.
-   return head

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity, two pointers

-   We take 2 pointers, fast and slow. (here both move equally i.e. 1 node at a time)
-   move fast pointer n times.
-   if fast is null return head->next
-   now move slow and fast pointers together until fast->next != NULL.
-   slow->next = slow->next->next
-   Delete deleted node.
-   **NOTE:** This method have same complexity as above method.

# [20. Valid Parentheses](./20_validParentheses.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space, straightforward solution

-   if the string is empty, return true
-   if the string has an odd number of characters, return false
-   Create a stack to store parenthesis.
-   if character is any opening parenthesis, push it to the stack
-   after first if, if stack is empty, which means the character is closing parenthesis, return false
-   else
    -   current character is matching parenthesis of top char of stack, pop that opening character from stack.
    -   else push it in the stack.
-   return true if stack is empty else false.

### Some slight simplification

-   we don't need to push extra closing parenthesis in the stack, if extra parenthesis appears return false.

-   l1 will always contain list of smaller value
    -   l1 will contain smaller val always;
    -   store l1 in result;
-   until any list is empty, run loop
    -   Create a temp node which points to nullptr
    -   while l1 has smaller element than l2, add l1 to temp
    -   after loop l2 will have smaller value than l1
    -   by swapping l1 and l2, l1 will contain smaller value
-   return final result which is pointer to l1 list

### O(N+M) Time and O(1) Space, Recursive

-   We will recursively join two linked list such that they will be always sorted.

# [50. Pow(x, n)](./50_powXn.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time Brute force

-   if n is `0`, return `1.0`
-   set `ans = x`
-   We iterate N times and multiply `ans` with `x`.
-   If **N is negative**, we convert it to **positive** and then multiply with `x` and finally return `1/result`.
-   But there is one **edge case**, given that `n` is `integer` and range of integers is **-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647** so if we convert -2,147,483,648 to positive, it will **overflow**.
-   To tackle this edge case, we can use **long** type.

### O(log2_N) optimized

-   Math concept `2^5 = 2*(2^4) = 2*(4^2) = 2*16 = 32`
-   if n is even we can divide it half and do multiplication
-   if n is odd we can multiply 1 x with ans and reduce it to even number.
-   when it will be 0 we stop the loop.

# [73. Set Matrix Zeroes](./73_setMatrixZeroes.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Brute Force

-   For every 0 in matrix we set its entire row and column to -1(if all values are positive)
-   after whole matrix is traversed, we set all -1 to 0;
-   **Time Complexity: O(m\*n) \* (m+n)**
    -   m\*n : to traverse the array
    -   m+n : to traverse the row and column for the element.
-   **Space Complexity: O(1)**

### O(m+n) space optimization

-   We take 2 vectors 1 for row and 1 for column.
-   We traverse in matrix and if the element is 0, we set the corresponding row and column vector index to 0.
-   After the traversal, we again traverse the matrix and if any of the row or column vector at that index is 0, we set the element to 0.
-   **Time complexity: 2\*O(N\*M) --> O(N\*M)**

### O(1) Space Optimization

-   Instead of creating 2 new vectors for row and column we can take first row and first column of matrix for marking.
-   We traverse the whole array and if the element is 0, we set the corresponding row and column vector index to 0.
-   For the first col there is one special case, if we set first col to 0 so the row will unnecessarily have 0's in them.
-   to tackle this case we take `col` variable and set it `true` initially. while traversing the array if we got any 0 in first column so we change `col = false`.
-   Now we traverse from bottom-right to top-left and if we found 0 in any marker vector we set current element to 0.
-   for the first column, if `col==false` we set it to 0.
-   **Time complexity: 2\*O(N\*M) --> O(N\*M)**

### DP Solution(Tabulation)

-   We have base conditions of `dp[0] = dp[1] = 1.`
-   Then we calculate result for each number of nodes `i` from `2...n.`
-   For `i` nodes. we can consider each of the node `j` from `1...i` as the root node.
-   Considering the jth node as the root node in BST having total of `i` nodes, the result is summation for all `j` from `1...i` of `dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]`. (Comparing to above solution `dp[j-1] = numTrees(j-1) and dp[i-j]=numTrees(i-j)`)

# [101. Symmetric Tree](./101_symmetricTree.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time solution

-   we will traverse left and right subtrees of the root with the same type of traversal.
-   we compare the value of left with right or value of right with left , if they are not equal we return false.
-   we recurse for left's left with right's right and left's right with right's left.

### O(N) Time, using 2 queue, iterative solution

-   Same recursive solution can be converted to iterative solution by using queue.
-   Remember while using 2 queue we push `left->left,left->right` in 1st queue and `right->right,right->left` in 2nd queue.

### O(N) Time, using 1 queue, iterative solution

-   We can use 1 queue instead of 2.
-   remember that while using 1 queue we do `left->left,right->right,left->right,right->left.`

-   Brute force:
-   For each day, find the max profit that can be made by buying at that day and selling at the next j days.

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space

-   We try to sell stock each day.
-   For each day from last we store maximum stock price that will appear.
-   then for each day we calculate by selling the stock.

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space

-   We try to buy stock each day.
-   For each day we keep track of the minimum price of the stock that appeared before it.
-   if todays stock price is minimum we will update it.

# [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](./129_sumRootToLeafNumbers.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time recursive

-   We recursively traverse to the all leaf node.
-   Multiply val by 10 and add curr val in it.
-   if both left and right child is null, we add the current node value to the sum.
-   else recurse for left anf right subtree.
-   Stack can grow upto the height of the tree so that we can explore the path from root to leaf node.
-   Thus, **Space Complexity = O(Height of the tree)**
-   **Time Complexity:O(N)** --> All Nodes will be visited once.

# [155. Min Stack](./155_minStack.md) ðŸŒŸ

### TIP

-   Solving a question to implement stack using stack is possible , but not a good idea.
-   you can use 2 vector, 1 vector, vector of pair or map to implement the stack.

### Time Complexity: O(1) for all the solutions.

### Space Complexity: Extra O(N) Space used.

### Using 2 Vectors

-   We maintain 2 vectors, 1 for stack implementation and another for min stack.push `INT_MAX` to min stack in declaration.
-   `push` operation:
    -   push element to stack.
    -   push min element to min stack.
-   `pop` operation:
    -   pop element from stack.
    -   pop min element from min stack.
-   `top` operation:
    -   return top element from stack.
-   `getMin` operation:
    -   return top element from min stack.

### Using 1 vector

-   Instead of 2 vectors, we can use 1 vector to implement the stack.
-   `push` operation:
    -   if minElement is greater or equal to val, push minElement to stack and update minElement to val.
    -   then push val in the stack.
-   `pop` operation:
    -   pop the top of the stack.
    -   if top is equal to minElement, minElement will be top(next top) of the stack and pop the top(next top) from stack.

### Using vector of pair

-   Self explanatory code

# [169. Majority Element](./169_majorityElement.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Brute force

-   For every number in array we count its occurrences.
-   If count is greater than n/2, then we return the number.

### O(N)Time with extra space

-   we Can take a vector or unordered_map to store the frequency of each element.
-   We traverse the hash map/ vector to find the n/2 frequency.
-   if we found we return the element.
-   **TC: O(N)**
-   **SC:O(N)/O(N^2)** - _Yes if we use unordered_map it's worst case time complexity is **O(N^2)**, which occurs when all elements are divisible by prime number and result in collision_. But if we use frequency vector it's worst case time complexity is **O(N)**.

### Moore's Voting Algorithm

-   **TC:O(N)**
-   **SC:O(1)**
-   We maintain 2 variables count and candidate.
-   We traverse the array and for every element we do following:
    -   If count is 0, then we set candidate as current element.
    -   If current element is same as candidate, then we increment count by 1.
    -   else we decrement count by 1.
-   return candidate.

### O(log N \* log N) Time

-   The idea behind the algorithm is - A complete binary tree has `2^h - 1` nodes, where `h` is the height of the tree.
-   so we get the left and right hight of the tree.
-   if the are equal, then we can directly return `2^(left) - 1`
-   else we check for its right and left subtree and return `1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);`

# [227. Basic Calculator II](./227_basicCalculatorII.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Using Stack

-   Scan the string from left to right
    -   If the current character is a digit add it to the number currentNumber.
    -   Otherwise, the current character must be an operation (+,-,\*, /). Evaluate the expression based on the type of operation.
        -   _Addition (+) or Subtraction (-):_ We must evaluate the expression later based on the next operation. So, we must store the currentNumber to be used later. Let's push the currentNumber in the Stack.
        -   _Multiplication (\*) or Division (/):_ Pop the top values from the stack and evaluate the current expression. Push the evaluated value back to the stack.
-   Once the string is scanned, pop from the stack and add to the result.
-   **TC: O(n)**
-   **SC: O(n)**

### Without Stack

The approach works similar to Approach 1 with the following differences :

-   Instead of using a stack, we use a variable lastNumber to track the value of the last evaluated expression.
-   If the operation is Addition (+) or Subtraction (-), add the lastNumber to the result instead of pushing it to the stack. The currentNumber would be updated to lastNumber for the next iteration.
-   If the operation is Multiplication (\*) or Division (/), we must evaluate the expression lastNumber \* currentNumber and update the lastNumber with the result of the expression. This would be added to the result after the entire string is scanned.
-   **TC: O(n)**
-   **SC: O(1)**

### O(N) Time and O(1) space

-   we Can take a vector or unordered_map to store the frequency of each element.
-   We traverse the hash map/ vector to find the n/3 frequency.
-   if we found we return the element.
-   **TC: O(N)**
-   **SC:O(N)/O(N^2)** - _Yes if we use unordered_map it's worst case time complexity is **O(N^2)**, which occurs when all elements are divisible by prime number and result in collision_. But if we use frequency vector it's worst case time complexity is **O(N)**.

### Moore's Voting Algorithm

-   **TC:O(N)**
-   **SC:O(1)**
-   The intuition and method is same as `majority element` problem but here we maintain 2 cnt variables and 2 candidate because in the question it is given that at most 2 majority element will be present or there may be no element present.

### MUST READ:

**let's analyze why this problem **isn't** a good interview question.**

```
The whole point of asking any candidates a linked list problem is to test if the candidates think about edge cases, including:

1. Dereferencing Null Pointer, usually targeting tail pointer
2. When given Head is None
3. When there are duplications in the list
```

# [238. Product of Array Except Self](./238_productOfArrayExceptSelf.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Intuitive Solution

-   We can take the product of all the elements in the array and then divide it by the element at the current index.
-   We should take care of cases where num == 0.
-   If there are more than 1 zero ans array will be all 0.
-   If there is only one 0 then ans array will be all 0 except at the index where 0 appears.
-   **TC: O(N)**
-   **SC: O(1)**

### Using Extra space

-   Since we need product of left and right elements, we can think of following solution
-   We precalculate the product form left side in the left array and the product from right side in the right array.
-   Here corner cases are:
    -   ans[0] = right[1]
    -   ans[n-1] = left[n-2]
-   **TC: O(N)**
-   **SC: O(N)**, since we are using 2 extra vectors to store the prefix product and suffix product.

### Space optimization

-   Instead of using 2 extra left and right array for storing prefix and suffix product, we can use owr ans vector to do both.since its given that ans vector will not considered as extra space.
-   first store the prefix multiplication in ans vector.
-   Then we ge ans[i] by multiplying `ans[i-1] and right[i+1]` here `right[i+1]=prod` so `ans[i] = ans[i - 1] * prod;`
-   from right each time we get num from right side and multiply it with the previous product.
-   finally `ans[0]=prod` itself
-   **TC: O(N)**
-   **SC: O(1)**

-   if we found duplicates we increase i by 2 else we add number in ans.
-   if ans.size()==2 thn we can break loop, since we have only 2 unique elements.

### O(N) Time HashMap solution

-   We can use `set` or `map` to solve this problem in O(N) time.

### O(N) Time O(1) Bit Manipulation solution

Idea is to use property of XOR:

```
1. xor(a, a) = 0
2. xor(a, 0) = xor(0, a) = a
3. xor(1, 1) = xor(0, 0) = 0
4. xor(1, 0) = xor(0, 1) = 1
5. xor(a, b) = c => xor(a, c) = b and xor(b, c) = a
```

Let two distinct elements be: first and sec. Now, firstXorSec := xor(first, sec) = xor(nums[i], 0), 0 <= i < [n:= nums.size()], why? because nums has odd and even freq. elements, doing xor will cancel out elements with even freq. using the 1. property of xor. So, at the end, xor of only odd freq. elements i.e first and sec remains.

Now, first != sec => there is at least 1 set bit in firstXorSec. Using 4. property of xor, one of first and sec, must have a set bit (Let it be first). We find/ denote this rightmost set bit using mask: has all bits 0 except the rightmost set bit in firstXorSec. So, we can divide the elements in nums in two groups A and B, where:

```
1. groupA: (num & mask) == 1 i.e bit is set
2. groupB: (num & mask) == 0 i.e bit is not set
```

Clearly, both first and sec belong to different groups and since, all other elements occurs in pair, so, we can safely again use 1. property of xor to generate first. Finally, using 5. property of xor, we have `sec = xor(firstXorSec, first)`

# [441. Arranging Coins](./441_arrangingCoins.md) ðŸŒŸ

### Simulation

-   We can just simulate the process of building the staircase.
-   Assume we have k as result, `1+2+...+i = N`, then `i*(i+1) = 2N => i^2 = N => i = sqrt(N)`
-   **Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))**

### Binary Search

-   The problem can be converted into - Find the maximum k such that `k*(k+1)/2 <= n`.
-   **Time Complexity: O(logN)**

### Math solution

-   As we know the number of coins in each staircase are forming an AP `Eg :- 1+2+3+...+a = n`
    Sum of all terms of AP :- `(1+a)a/2 = n`
    n is given to us in question, we have to find a
-   ```
    ===> a ^ 2 + a = 2 n
    ===> x ^ 2 + a + 1/4 = 2 n +1/4
    ===> (a + 1/2 ) ^ 2 = 2n + 1/4
    ===> (a + 0.5) = sqrt( 2n + 1/4 )
    ===> a = -0.5 + sqrt( 2n + 1/4 )
    ```
-   We have calculated the value of `a = -0.5 + sqrt( 2\*n + 1/4 )`

# [450. Delete Node in a BST](./450_deleteNodeInBst.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Solution

1. **find the key node:** there are **3 cases**

```cpp
    if(key < root) -> find in left subtree
    else if(key > root) -> find in right subtree
    else (key==root) -> delete the node
```

2. **Now delete the node:** there are **3 cases**

```cpp
    if leaf node(0 child)  -> delete(node) and return NULL
    else if node having 1 child  -> delete(node) and return the child
    else  (node having 2 children){
      i) find smallest node (leftmost) in the right subtree of the key
      ii) copy the smallest node value with key node
      iii) delete that smallest node from right subtree (as it have only 1 or 0 child)}
```

**Alternative: In the condition of node having 2 children, we can also find largest node (rightmost) of left subtree of the key.**

# [461. Hamming Distance](./461_hammingDistance.md) ðŸŒŸ

### Original Post - [4 Solutions](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/discuss/1585474/C%2B%2BPython-4-Simple-Solutions-w-Explanations-or-XOR-and-Brian-Kernighan-method)

### Converting Binary Form to String/Array & Iterating

-   The most basic way one could solve this question is by simply taking the number, converting them to binary form's string / array and iterating over it to find the number of positions at which bits are different.
-   **TC : O(N)**, where `N` is the `number of bits` in the given input numbers
-   **SC : O(N)**, required to store the input number's binary form.

### Iterating & Comparing each Bit

-   We can also iterate over each bit of the given numbers manually and then compare the bits at each position.
-   To check if the `ith` bit of a number `x` is set, we can perform - `(x >> i) & 1`.
-   If the bit differ at a given position, we increment the count of hamming distance.
-   **TC : O(N)**, to iterate over each bit of the number.
-   **SC : O(1)**, No extra space required.

### XOR & count bits

-   We can XOR x and y and count the number of set bits in the result.
-   To count the number of set bits we can use these inbuilt options:
    ```cpp
    ans = bitset<32>(Xor).count()
    ans = __builtin_popcount(Xor);
    ans = popcount(Xor)            // only since C++20
    ```
-   OR below is code to do it manually.
-   **TC : O(N)**, to iterate over each bit of the number.
-   **SC : O(1)**, No extra space required.

### Brian-Kernighan's method

-   We can use Brian Kernighan's method to count the number of set bits in the XOR of the two numbers.
-   Take a XOR of x and y.
-   Clear(unset) the rightmost bit by `n & (n - 1)` until xor becomes 0 and increment the count each time.
-   **TC : O(K)**, where K is the hamming distance between given numbers. This assume XOR operation as O(1)
-   **SC : O(1)**, No extra space required.

### ðŸ’¡ Note:

1. The number of bits `N` for this problem is fixed to `32`. So, strictly speaking, the time complexity of 1st three solutions is `O(N) = O(32) = O(1)`. But to differentiate between time complexities of 1st three and last approach, I have denoted them as `O(N)`.
2. It's likely that if you got such a question during an interview, you will probably be expected to come up with an approach similar to this one. This approach performs the least number of loops to find the number of set bits in a number which is equal to the number of set bits in the number itself.

# [492. Construct the Rectangle](./492_constructTheRectangle.md) ðŸŒŸ

### Iterative Solution

-   Since `l >= w` always, w will not be larger than sqrt(area).
-   If we can find w then `l = area / w`.
-   We just simulate the process from sqrt(area) to 1, since in the condition it is given that the difference between L and W should be as small as possible.
-   **TC: O(k)** where k is the sqrt of the area.
-   **SC: O(1)**

### Recursive Solution

-   From above iterative solution, we can also write recursive solution.
-   **TC: O(k)** where k is the sqrt of the area.
-   **SC: O(k)** because of recursive stack.

### linear search

-   We can linearly search the array for the element.
-   for each time we increment the i by 2 and check for adjacent elements.
-   if the element is not equal to the previous element then we return the current element.
-   **TC: O(N)**
-   **SC: O(1)**

### Bit Manipulation(XOR)

-   We know that xor of 2 same numbers is 0.In the question it is given that all number except the ans appear twice.
-   So we can use XOR to find the ans.
-   **TC: O(N)**
-   **SC: O(1)**

### Binary Search

-   We can observe that before unique elements every repeated element starts with even index and after unique elements every repeated element starts with odd index.
-   so we can just binary search the ans based on the even and odd indexes.
-   **TC: O(logN)**
-   **SC: O(1)**

# [542. 01 Matrix](./542_01Matrix.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### BFS solution

-   Firstly, we can see that the distance of all zero-cells are 0.
-   Same idea with Topology Sort, we process zero-cells first, then we use queue data structure to keep the order of processing cells, so that cells which have the smaller distance will be processed first. Then we expand the unprocessed neighbors of the current processing cell and push into our queue.
-   After all, we can achieve the minimum distance of all cells in our matrix.

**Complexity:**

-   Time: `O(M * N)`, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the matrix.
-   Space: `O(M * N)`, space for the queue.

### DP Solution

-   Firstly, we can see that the distance of all zero-cells are 0, so we skip zero-cells, we process one-cells only.
-   In DP, we can only use previous values if they're already computed.
-   In this problem, a cell has at most 4 neighbors that are left, top, right, bottom. If we use dynamic programming to compute the distance of the current cell based on 4 neighbors simultaneously, it's impossible because we are not sure if distance of neighboring cells is already computed or not.
-   That's why, we need to compute the distance one by one:
    -   Firstly, for a cell, we restrict it to only 2 directions which are left and top. Then we iterate cells from **top to bottom**, and from **left to right**, we calculate the distance of a cell **based on its left and top neighbors**.
    -   Secondly, for a cell, we restrict it only have 2 directions which are right and bottom. Then we iterate cells from **bottom to top**, and from **right to left**, we update the distance of a cell **based on its right and bottom neighbors**.

**Complexity:**

-   Time: `O(M * N)`, where M is number of rows, N is number of columns in the matrix.
-   Space: `O(1)`

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

-   Then, we use two pointers which begins from the start and end of the array to find if there is a sum k.

### O(hn) Time and O(h) space

-   `h` is the height of the tree, which is `log n` at best case, and `n` at worst case.
-   The idea is to use binary search method.
-   For each node, we check if k - node.val exists in this BST.

# [797. All Paths From Source to Target](./797_allPathsFromSourceToTarget.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### BFS

-   We can start from the starting node 0 and traverse every possible next node from the current node.
-   Whenever we reach the last node n-1, we will add the path till now into the final answer.

This process can be implemented using a BFS traversal as -

-   Initialize a queue of path of nodes with the node 0 inserted into it initially denoting the starting node in our traversal path from 0 to n-1
-   Pop an element path from the queue
-   Explore every child node of last node in the path. That is, we try every possible edge in graph from node at the end of current path. Each edge added to end of path gives us another path which will be added to queue for further exploration
-   If the last node in path is n-1, we know that this is a valid source to target path in the graph. So, we add it to final list of paths
-   We repeat this process until the queue is not empty, that is, until there are paths remaining to be explored.
-   **Time Complexity : O(2^N)**, where N is the number of nodes in the graph. Every node except the start and end node of graph can either be part of a path or not be part of a path. For a path consisting of k (`3 <= k <= n`) nodes, we have k-2 intermediate nodes and we can choose from n-2 available nodes. Thus the resulting time complexity is `Î£ n-2Ck-2` for all `3 <= k <= n`, which comes out to be `O(2N-2) = O(2N)`
-   **Space Complexity : O(2^N)**

### DFS - Backtracking

-   We can also solve this problem using DFS traversal.
-   This traversal should also be more efficient in terms of space usage as compared to BFS traversal since we are only required to keep a single path in memory at a given time.
-   Note that we don't need to maintain a data structure such as seen to keep track of visited nodes since this is a DAG and thus no recursive dfs call will end up visiting same node twice.

The process of finding all paths using DFS can be implemented as -

-   Begin DFS traversal from the node 0
-   At each step of DFS, add the current node i to the path.
-   If the current node i in dfs call is n-1, we know that this is a valid source to target path in the graph. So, we add it to final list of paths.
-   Otherwise, we explore further path by trying each possible next nodes, that is, we recursively call DFS for every child node of i in the graph.
-   The above process continues till every possible path is tried out by dfs.

-   **Time Complexity : O(2^N)**, same as above
-   **Space Complexity : O(N)**, required by max recursive stack depth and for storing path. Generally output space is not considered towards overall space complexity.

### O(N) Slow and Fast pointer

-   **NOTE: It works for all `Find middle` Questions.**
-   Each time, slow go 1 steps while fast go 2 steps.
-   When fast arrives at the end, slow will arrive right in the middle.
-   `fast != NULL` for odd number of nodes.
-   `fast->next != NULL` for even number of nodes.

-   There are 2 main conditions for the town judge if it exists.
    -   1. The town judge trusts no one.
    -   2. Everyone (except the town judge)(n-1 people) trusts the town judge.
-   So we can build trusts array in which we store how many person , the current person trusts.
-   also we can build trusted array in which we store the current person is trusted by how many people.
-   So the answer will be simple, if any person has `trusts count == 0` and `trusted count == n-1`(everyone except town judge), then it is the town judge.else we return -1.

### Brute force (TLE)

-   We can find all the pairs from the time array which are divisible by `60`
-   **TC: O(N^2)**
-   **SC: O(1)**

### Hashing Solution

-   `t % 60` gets the remainder from `0 to 59`.
-   We _count the occurrence of each remainders_ in a _array/hashmap_ `mp`.
-   we want to know that, for each `t` in `time`,
-   how many `x` satisfy `(t + x) % 60 = 0`.
-   The straight forward idea is to take `x % 60 = 60 - (t % 60)`, which is valid for the most cases.
-   But, if `t % 60 = 0` then `x % 60` should be `0` instead of `60`.
-   there are two solutions to avoid this situation,
    -   `x % 60 = (60 - t % 60) % 60`,
    -   `x % 60 = (600 - t) % 60`.
-   **TC: O(N)**, Single for loop
-   **SC: O(N)**, for the extra space to store the remainders.

# [1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle](./1178_numberOfValidWordsForEachPuzzle.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Bit masking with hashmap

-   We set all the bits of the corresponding indices of each letter, then we easily see if it's a submask.
-   we create a hashmap to keep the frequency of each mask, so that if we have two words with the same letter we will count both.
-   we iterate through the puzzles
-   We need to find all combinations of submasks to check. This is the faster than iterating through all the words because each puzzle is only 7 letters.
-   For that we just do (submask-1) & mask - we are turning off a bit by subtracting one which sets the lowest 1 to 0 and all 0s in the right to 1s, and then we do & with the original mask to get only the desired bits.

### Interview Tips

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-1</b></summary>
In a real interview, if you are unsure how to solve the problem, a good first step is to remain calm and reread the problem description looking for hidden clues.
  Also, remember to ask the interviewer about the problem constraints. The constraints are very important for solving problems as they can help us determine which data structures and algorithms can feasibly be used to solve the problem.
  However, if the interviewer chooses to deliberately hide the constraints, then they likely want you to find different methods under different assumed constraints. Although, on rare occasions, a problem may be too simple to provide constraints.
</details>

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-2</b></summary>
A constraint under `10` usually accepts a method with `N!` time complexity with respect to this constraint. Factorial time complexities can occur for operations like finding all permutations from a set or using brute-force to solve the traveling salesman problem.
  A constraint under `30` usually accepts a method with `2^N` time complexity at worst with respect to this constraint. Some examples include iterating over all combinations or subsets from a set or some brute-force solutions that use `DFS`.
  However, a solution with better time complexity can still exist even when the constraints are small. One should use the constraints to estimate the complexity of the worst acceptable solution, not the best solution.
</details>

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-3</b></summary>
When you still do not have any idea after rereading the problem, you can try a brute-force method that works but may have an unacceptable time complexity.
  Then you can either try to improve on the brute-force method or gain some insight from the brute-force method.
</details>

<details>
        <summary><b>Interview Tip-4</b></summary>
In an interview, if the first solution that comes to mind involves a complex data structure, you can wait a minute and try thinking of other similar methods. In a real-world setting, we typically prioritize efficiency and readability. We prioritize these characteristics in an interview setting as well, however, we also value solutions that we are less likely to make a mistake while coding and solutions that do not require a long time to code.
  In this problem, you should consider your level of familiarity with the trie data structure before choosing between implementing a solution using a trie or a set. If the more comfortable approach is not the most efficient, then you should also weigh the increased chance of making a mistake versus the gain of having a more efficient solution.
  Worry not, as we will cover both methods in this article.

### Prerequisites:

-   **Backtracking**
-   **77. Combinations**

### Backtracking Solution (Efficient)

-   First, in the initialization, we recompute all the combinations of given string , and store the
    string of `combinationLength` in the `combination` vector. It will be done in **O(2^n)** time and also in **Dictionary order**.
-   In the `next()` function, from the `combination` vector, we return the next combination.
-   In the `hasNext()` function, we check if the `combination` vector has the next combination or not.

### Bitmasking Solution (Not more efficient)

-   Here change is, we use bitmasking to compute all the combinations. takes **O(2^n)** time.
-   but we need to have additional map to store the combinations in sorted order. takes **O(log N)** time.

-   Then, we loop over all elements and check if that particular rotation is valid or not. If not, we turn it to false.
-   In the end, we simply check if any of the rotations is still possible or not.

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space solution

-   For i=0 to n , simply do what they have asked to.
-   Push_back(nums[nums[i]])

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space optimization

-   This is done to keep both old and new value together.
-   going by the example of [5,0,1,2,3,4], n = 6(size of array)
-   `nums[i] = nums[i]+(n*(nums[nums[i]]%n));`
-   after this nums[0] will be 5 + 6\*(4%6) = 5 + 24 = 29;
-   now for next index calculation we might need the original value of num[0] which can be obtain by num[0]%6 = 29%6 = 5;
-   if we want to get just the new value of num[0], we can get it by num[0]/6 = 29/6 = 4

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space solution

-   We will use inbuilt function `vector.insert()` to concatenate the arrays.
