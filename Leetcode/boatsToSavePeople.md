Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit)
    {
        int n = people.size();
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int i = 0, j = n - 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        while (i <= j) {
            if (people[j] == limit) {
                cnt++;
                j--;
            } else if (people[i] + people[j] <= limit) {
                cnt++;
                i++;
                j--;
            } else {
                cnt++;
                j--;
            }
        }
