# Leetcode Problem 1900-1999

# [1920. Build Array from Permutation](./1920_buildArrayFromPermutation.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space solution

-   For i=0 to n , simply do what they have asked to.
-   Push_back(nums[nums[i]])

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space optimization

-   This is done to keep both old and new value together.
-   going by the example of [5,0,1,2,3,4], n = 6(size of array)
-   `nums[i] = nums[i]+(n*(nums[nums[i]]%n));`
-   after this nums[0] will be 5 + 6\*(4%6) = 5 + 24 = 29;
-   now for next index calculation we might need the original value of num[0] which can be obtain by num[0]%6 = 29%6 = 5;
-   if we want to get just the new value of num[0], we can get it by num[0]/6 = 29/6 = 4

# [1929. Concatenation of Array](./1929_ConcatenationOfArray.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space solution

-   We will use inbuilt function `vector.insert()` to concatenate the arrays.

# [1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph](./1971_findIfPathExistsInGraph.md) ðŸŒŸ

### DFS

-   Basic DFS with stack

### UnionFind

-   If path exist between 2 nodes then they are in same component.
-   We can use UnionFind to know if source and destination are in same component.
