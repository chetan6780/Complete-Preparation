# Leetcode Problem 1500-1599

[1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence](./1502_canMakeArithmeticProgressionFromSequence.md) ðŸŒŸ

### Simple Solution

-   Sort the array.
-   Check if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same or not.
-   **TC: O(NlogN)**: For sorting
-   **SC: O(1)**: Excluding sorting space, No extra space required. OR
-   **SC: O(logN) || O(N)**: Considering Space required for internal sorting. in C++ its O(logN) for py its O(N).
