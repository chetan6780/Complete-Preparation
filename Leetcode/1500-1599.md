# Leetcode Problem 1500-1599

[1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence](./1502_canMakeArithmeticProgressionFromSequence.md) ðŸŒŸ

### Simple Solution

-   Sort the array.
-   Check if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same or not.
-   **TC: O(NlogN)**: For sorting
-   **SC: O(1)**: Excluding sorting space, No extra space required. OR
-   **SC: O(logN) || O(N)**: Considering Space required for internal sorting. in C++ its O(logN) for py its O(N).

### O(N^2) Time O(1) Space solution

-   Check for each element of array and return the ans.

### O(N) Time O(N) Space optimization

-   Use map to store if the number appeared before or not.
-   If it appeared add frequency to ans.else add it to map.

### Simulation

-   If k >= n, then the max element will always win the game, as it will not change its position from 0 index.
-   If k < n, then we need to simulate the game.
-   We need to keep track of the current winner and the number of consecutive wins.
-   If the current winner wins, then we increment the number of consecutive wins.
-   If the current winner loses, then we set the number of consecutive wins to 1.
-   If the number of consecutive wins is equal to k, then we return the current winner.
-   Else, we return the last winner.
-   **TC:** O(n)
-   **SC:** O(1)
