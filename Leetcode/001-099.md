# Leetcode Problem 001-099

# [1. Two Sum](./1_twoSum.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N^2) Time Constant space

-   Brute force - check every pair of numbers.

### O(N) Time and O(N) space

-   The basic idea is to maintain a hash table for each element num in nums
-   using num as key and its index (0-based) as value. For each num, search for target - num in the hash table.
-   If it is found and is not the same element as num, then we are done.

# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./3_longestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^3) Time, O(N) space

-   Brute force
-   We can consider all substrings one by one and check for each substring whether it contains all unique characters or not.
-   There will be n\*(n+1)/2 substrings.
-   Whether a substring contains all unique characters or not can be checked in linear time by scanning it from left to right and keeping a map of visited characters.
-   Time complexity of this solution would be O(n^3).

### O(N^2) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

-   For every i in string we check, **How long the substring starting with index i have unique characters**

### O(N) Time O(N) space, Sliding window

-   We keep track of unique characters in a hashmap(unordered_set).
-   l is left index and r is right index, these indicates unique substring's start and end.
-   if r'th character is not present in set, we add it and increment r also update `maxLength = max(maxLength, r-l);`
-   if r'th character is present in set, we remove it from set and increment l pointer.
-   finally return maxLength.

# [11. Container With Most Water](./11_containerWithMostWater.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Brute force (TLE)

-   Try all possible combinations of lines and find the maximum area out of them.
-   take min of heights of two lines and multiply it with the distance between them.
-   **Time complexity:** O(n^2)
-   **Space complexity:** O(1)

### Two pointer approach

-   To optimize the brute force approach, we can use two pointer approach.
-   we need to maximize the area, so we will start with the maximum width possible.
-   take one pointer at the start and one at the end.
-   calculate or update the area.
-   now we got an area but can we do better? may be we find more taller line and area will increase.
-   to do it, lets move the pointer which is pointing to the shorter line to the next line.
-   repeat the process until both the pointers meet.
-   **Time complexity:** O(n)
-   **Space complexity:** O(1)

# [12. Integer to Roman](./12_integerToRoman.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Greedy solution

-   Ask interviewer if there could be negative numbers or 0.
-   Ask if the number is guaranteed to be in the range 1 to 3999.
-   We create 2 arrays to store the Roman numerals and their corresponding values.
-   Greedily we try to subtract largest possible number from the input number, and assign their corresponding Roman numeral to the result string.
-   We repeat this process until the input number becomes 0.
-   **Time complexity: O(n)=O(1)**, where n is the number of Roman numerals, here constant because we know the number of Roman numerals is 13.
-   **Space complexity: O(n)=O(1)**, where n is the number of Roman numerals, here constant because we know the number of Roman numerals is 13.

### Fun solution

-   As human being came so far they evolved and they created some flexing solutions, but just don't flex this solution before interviewer.
-   **TC: O(1)**, indeed.
-   **SC: O(1)**, indeed.
-   Don't evolve more and create 4\*10 array to store all the Roman numerals.

# [15. 3Sum](./15_3sum.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^3 Log m) Brute force

-   Travel all the triplets which sums to 0.
-   Pseudo code

```
    for(i=0,n-1)
        for(j=i+1,n-1)
            for(k=j+1,n-1)
                a+b+c==0, cnt++
```

-   To get unique triplets, we can use set data structure.
-   N^3 for for loop and Log M for inserting unique triplets in the set.
-   **SC:** O(M), M is all unique triplets.

### O(N^2 Log M) Time and O(N)+O(M) Space

-   we can run 2 for loops for a and b.
-   store c in hashmap with its frequency
-   while running loops we have to decrease frequency of a and b inorder to find unique c.
-   then we find c=-(a+b) in the hashmap.
-   store the 3 numbers in sorted order in set so we will not have duplicates.
-   O(N^2) for 2 loops, Log(M) for inserting in set.
-   O(N) for map and O(M) For set.

### Two pointers.

-   Sort the array.
-   Fix a and you just need to find b+c=-a which is two sum problem.
-   To not get duplicates we increment pointer in such way that they are not equal to their previous values.
-   **TC:O(N\*N)**
-   **SC:O(M)**, M is the number of triplets.

# [18. 4Sum](./18_4sum.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N^4) brute force

-   using 4 for loops we can solve this question.

### Sort + 3ptr + BinarySearch (int overflow)

-   **TC: O(N^3)** - 2loops and finding 2 elements in O(N) time.
-   **SC: O(N^2)** - set of vectors
-   we keep i,j,k pointers and find l using binary search.

### TIP:

-   We can use following code to remove duplicates from vector.
-   ```cpp
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    v.erase(unique(v.begin(), v.end()), v.end());
    ```
-   See my [GFG Solution](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-all-four-sum-numbers1732/1) for better understanding.

### Sort + 2ptr + BinarySearch

-   **TC: O(N^3)** - 2loops and finding 2 elements in O(N) time.
-   **SC: O(1)**
-   we keep i,j pointers and find l and r using binary search.
-   We can **overcome int overflow** by calculating target in every loop.(see code)
-   We can also overcome extra space by processing pointers until duplicates occurs.(see code)

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity

-   Get the length of the linked list.
-   if n = length then return head->next
-   n = length - n
-   go to n-1th node then set its next to its next->next.
-   delete the space of removed node, else it will cause memory leak.
-   return head

### O(N) Time and O(1) Space Complexity, two pointers

-   We take 2 pointers, fast and slow. (here both move equally i.e. 1 node at a time)
-   move fast pointer n times.
-   if fast is null return head->next
-   now move slow and fast pointers together until fast->next != NULL.
-   slow->next = slow->next->next
-   Delete deleted node.
-   **NOTE:** This method have same complexity as above method.

# [20. Valid Parentheses](./20_validParentheses.md) ðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time and O(N) Space, straightforward solution

-   if the string is empty, return true
-   if the string has an odd number of characters, return false
-   Create a stack to store parenthesis.
-   if character is any opening parenthesis, push it to the stack
-   after first if, if stack is empty, which means the character is closing parenthesis, return false
-   else
    -   current character is matching parenthesis of top char of stack, pop that opening character from stack.
    -   else push it in the stack.
-   return true if stack is empty else false.

### Some slight simplification

-   we don't need to push extra closing parenthesis in the stack, if extra parenthesis appears return false.

-   l1 will always contain list of smaller value
    -   l1 will contain smaller val always;
    -   store l1 in result;
-   until any list is empty, run loop
    -   Create a temp node which points to nullptr
    -   while l1 has smaller element than l2, add l1 to temp
    -   after loop l2 will have smaller value than l1
    -   by swapping l1 and l2, l1 will contain smaller value
-   return final result which is pointer to l1 list

### O(N+M) Time and O(1) Space, Recursive

-   We will recursively join two linked list such that they will be always sorted.

                -   else we can not put i'th character in current cell,
            -   remove the i'th character from current cell
    -   if we are done with all characters for current cell, we can not get our solution, return false.

# [50. Pow(x, n)](./50_powXn.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### O(N) Time Brute force

-   if n is `0`, return `1.0`
-   set `ans = x`
-   We iterate N times and multiply `ans` with `x`.
-   If **N is negative**, we convert it to **positive** and then multiply with `x` and finally return `1/result`.
-   But there is one **edge case**, given that `n` is `integer` and range of integers is **-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647** so if we convert -2,147,483,648 to positive, it will **overflow**.
-   To tackle this edge case, we can use **long** type.

### O(log2_N) optimized

-   Math concept `2^5 = 2*(2^4) = 2*(4^2) = 2*16 = 32`
-   if n is even we can divide it half and do multiplication
-   if n is odd we can multiply 1 x with ans and reduce it to even number.
-   when it will be 0 we stop the loop.

### Recursive

# [51. N-Queens](./51_nQueens.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Brute force backtracking (8ms-AC)

-   **Main Algorithm** - we iterate over each row in the board, i.e. once we reach the last row of the board, we should have explored all the possible solutions. - At each iteration (we are located at certain row), we then further iterate over each column of the board, along the current row. At this second iteration, we then can explore the possibility of placing a queen on a particular cell. - Before, we place a queen on the cell with index of `(row, col)`, we need to check if this cell is under the attacking zone of the queens that have been placed on the board before. We can do it with `isSafe()` function. - Once the check passes, we then can proceed to place a queen. Along with the placement, one should also mark out the attacking zone of this newly-placed queen. We achieve this with `placeQueen()` function. - As an important behavior of backtracking, we should be able to abandon our previous decision at the moment we decide to move on to the next candidate. We achieve this with `removeQueen()` function.

-   **The time complexity of `nQueens` problem is dependent of how we implement `isSafe()` function.**

-   **`isSafe()` function**:
    -   We can check if the queen is placed in current row, current column, or the positive diagonal or negative diagonal.
    -   BUT, we don't need to do some redundant checks. like chekiang for the same row, lower column, lower positive and negative diagonal as we haven't traverse them yet.
    -   We just check upper positive and negative diagonal as well as upper column.
    -   We can do it by simple simulation.

### 3 vectors optimized backtracking (3ms-AC)

-   All the algorithm is same but we can optimize the `isSafe()` function by using extra space.

-   **`isSafe()` function**:
    -   We can have the `colSet` vector to store the column index of the queens that are placed on the board.
    -   also we can have `posDig` and `negDig` vectors to store the positive and negative diagonal indices of the queens that are placed on the board.
    -   We can get the **positive diagonal index** with **`col + row`**
    -   We can get the **negative diagonal index** with **`col - row + n - 1`**

### 1 vector optimized backtracking (7ms-AC)

-   Again same algorithm but we just used **1 vector** instead of **3 vectors**.

-   **`isSafe()` function**:

    -   **`flag[0] to flag[n - 1]`** to indicate if the column had a queen before.
    -   **`flag[n] to flag[3 * n - 2]`** to indicate if the **45Â° diagonal** had a queen before.
    -   **`flag[3 * n - 1] to flag[5 * n - 3]`** to indicate if the **135Â° diagonal** had a queen before.
    -   So we will declare **`flag(5 * n - 3)`** vector to store the information of the board.
    -   We can get the **positive diagonal index** with **`n + col + row`**
    -   We can get the **negative diagonal index** with **`4 * n - 2 + col - row`**

-   if it does, merge the two intervals.
-   if it doesn't, add it to the result.

### O(NlogN) Time O(N) Space Solution

-   Check for invalid case.
-   Sort the intervals by start time.
-   Take first pair of interval.
-   iterate over intervals and check if they overlap or not.
-   if they overlap, then change temp pair to `max(temp[1],x[1])`.
-   else push temp pair to result and change temp pair to x.

### O(NlogN) Time O(1) Space Solution

-   If we not consider the vector ans, which we have to return this problem can be solved without using temp vector.
-   We can simply use vector.back and do the operations on it.

# [63. Unique Paths II](./63_uniquePathII.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Recursion (TLE)

-   The straightforward solution is to use recursion.
-   We have choice to go right or go down.
-   we return right + left as we want to find all the paths.
-   the base case arises when we reach to our destination i.e.(m-1, n-1), we return 1.
-   also if we encounter an obstacle Or one of our indexes goes out of range, we return 0.

### Memoization (AC)

-   **SC: O(m\*n)**

### Tabulation (AC)

-   We can also use tabulation to solve this problem.
-   But here are some edge case that we have to take care.
-   we fill first row with 1 and first column with 1.
-   but at any point in 1st row or column we encounter an obstacle, we set the all farther value to 0.
-   other things are same as recursion.

# [64. Minimum Path Sum](./64_minimumPathSum.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Recursion (TLE)

-   For a cell in grid we can go either right or down.
-   We take minimum of right path and down path with current cell's value.
-   The base case arises when we reach to the last cell, then we return that cell's value.
-   also if we go out of bound the we return `INT_MAX`, because we are taking minimum of right and down.

### Memoization (AC)

-   The recursive solution will result in TLE, because of representing subproblems.
-   We can use memoization table to remember the result of subproblems.
-   If we have already computed the values of the subproblem then we directly return it from the table.
-   If we encounter new subproblem then we store it in the table.
-   **TC: O(m\*n)**
-   **SC: O(m\*n)**

### Tabulation (AC)

-   We can convert memoization method to tabulation method.
-   first we fill the bottom-right corner with the value of `grid[m-1][n-1]`, because it **Don't have any other choice**.
-   Then we fill last row and last column, because they have **Only one choice**.
-   Rest we can fill with regular method, they have **Two choices** we take minimum of both.
-   **TC: O(m\*n)**
-   **SC: O(m\*n)**

### Using stack

-   We create stringstream objects to store the path
-   We use a stack to store the directories
-   Iterate those the path,
    -   if it is "." or ""(we get "" when multiple '//' appears) continue
    -   if it is ".." and stack is not empty, pop the stack.
    -   if it is a directory, push it to the stack
-   append the stack to the result string.
-   **NOTE:** Appending from front is O(N^2) operation, we can reduce it by reversing the stack and appending to last of result string.
-   If result string is empty, return "/" else return result string.
-   **TC: O(N^2)** OR reverse the stack **O(N)**
-   **SC: O(N)**

# [73. Set Matrix Zeroes](./73_setMatrixZeroes.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Brute Force

-   For every 0 in matrix we set its entire row and column to -1(if all values are positive)
-   after whole matrix is traversed, we set all -1 to 0;
-   **Time Complexity: O(m\*n) \* (m+n)**
    -   m\*n : to traverse the array
    -   m+n : to traverse the row and column for the element.
-   **Space Complexity: O(1)**

### O(m+n) space optimization

-   We take 2 vectors 1 for row and 1 for column.
-   We traverse in matrix and if the element is 0, we set the corresponding row and column vector index to 0.
-   After the traversal, we again traverse the matrix and if any of the row or column vector at that index is 0, we set the element to 0.
-   **Time complexity: 2\*O(N\*M) --> O(N\*M)**

### O(1) Space Optimization

-   Instead of creating 2 new vectors for row and column we can take first row and first column of matrix for marking.
-   We traverse the whole array and if the element is 0, we set the corresponding row and column vector index to 0.
-   For the first col there is one special case, if we set first col to 0 so the row will unnecessarily have 0's in them.
-   to tackle this case we take `col` variable and set it `true` initially. while traversing the array if we got any 0 in first column so we change `col = false`.
-   Now we traverse from bottom-right to top-left and if we found 0 in any marker vector we set current element to 0.
-   for the first column, if `col==false` we set it to 0.
-   **Time complexity: 2\*O(N\*M) --> O(N\*M)**

    -   Towards the right of high everything is 2.
    -   In between low and high, everything is 1.
-   while(mid<=high) we do following.
    -   When we encounter 0.
        -   we swap low and mid.
        -   we increment low and mid.
    -   When we encounter 1.
        -   we increment mid.
    -   When we encounter 2.
        -   we swap mid and high.

# [91. Decode Ways](./91_decodeWays.md) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

### Recursive solution (TLE)

-   For a character in string we have 2 choices:
    -   We can use it as single character OR
    -   We can use it as a part of a two-character string
-   The base case arises when we cross length of the string, it means we have decoded all the characters.return 1.
-   And if character in string starts with '0' we cannot decode it, return 0.
-   finally we return `way1+way2` because we want to find all the possible ways to decode the string.
-   **TC: O(2^N)**

### Memoization (AC)

-   The recursive solution results in TLE, because of repeated calculation.
-   We can use memoization to store the result of subproblems.
-   If the subproblem is already calculated, we can return the result from the memoization table.
-   **TC: O(N)**

### DP Solution(Tabulation)

-   We have base conditions of `dp[0] = dp[1] = 1.`
-   Then we calculate result for each number of nodes `i` from `2...n.`
-   For `i` nodes. we can consider each of the node `j` from `1...i` as the root node.
-   Considering the jth node as the root node in BST having total of `i` nodes, the result is summation for all `j` from `1...i` of `dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]`. (Comparing to above solution `dp[j-1] = numTrees(j-1) and dp[i-j]=numTrees(i-j)`)
