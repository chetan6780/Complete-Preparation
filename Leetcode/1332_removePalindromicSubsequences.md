# [1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/) ðŸŒŸ

You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

### Note: Read Problem Description Carefully, we need to find palindromic **subsequence** not **substring**.

### using reverse function

### code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removePalindromeSub(string s) {
        string temp = s;
        reverse(temp.begin(),temp.end());
        if(temp==s) return 1;
        else return 2;
    }
};
```

### Checking if string is palindrome

```txt
if string is palindrome, return 1;
else return 2;
```
