# [617. Merge Two Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/) ðŸŒŸ

You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return the merged tree.

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

### DFS - Recursive

- if both nodes are null returns null.
- if one of the node null, return the other node.
- else Create new node with value = t1->val+t2->val.
- set new nodes left = merge(t1->left, t2->left)
- set new nodes right = merge(t1->right, t2->right)
- return new node;

**Time complexity**: **O(n)**. A total of n nodes need to be traversed. Here, n represents the minimum number of nodes from the two given trees.
**Space complexity**: **O(n)**. The depth of the recursion tree can go upto n in the case of a skewed tree. In average case, depth will be **O(log n)**.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution{
public:
    TreeNode *mergeTrees(TreeNode *root1, TreeNode *root2){
        if (root1 == NULL && root2 == NULL) return NULL;
        if (root1 == NULL) return root2;
        if (root2 == NULL) return root1;

        TreeNode *sum = new TreeNode(root1->val + root2->val);
        sum->left = mergeTrees(root1->left, root2->left);
        sum->right = mergeTrees(root1->right, root2->right);

        return sum;
    }
};
```

### BFS - Iterative

- Base condition as in recursion
- Create 2 queues for BFS and push root nodes in them.
- While both queues are not empty
  - Store the front nodes and Pop from both queues
  - Add value of 2nd node in 1st
  - if node1's left is null and node2's left is not null, then add node1's left to node2's left
  - else if both's left not null then push them in respective queues
  - if node1's right is null and node2's right is not null, then add node1's right to node2's right
  - else if both's right not null then push them in respective queues.

**Time complexity**: **O(n)**. A total of n nodes need to be traversed. Here, n represents the minimum number of nodes from the two given trees.
**Space complexity**: **O(n)**. The size of queue can go upto n in the case of a skewed tree.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution{
public:
    TreeNode *mergeTrees(TreeNode *t1, TreeNode *t2){
        // Base condition as in recursion
        if (t1 == NULL && t2 == NULL) return NULL;
        if (t1 == NULL) return t2;
        if (t2 == NULL) return t1;

        // Create 2 queues for BFS and push root nodes in them.
        queue<TreeNode *> q1, q2;
        q1.push(t1), q2.push(t2);

        // While both queues are not empty
        while (!q1.empty() && !q2.empty()){
            // Store the front nodes and Pop from both queues
            TreeNode *node1(q1.front()), *node2(q2.front());
            q1.pop(), q2.pop();

            // Add value of 2nd node in 1st
            node1->val += node2->val;

            // if node1's left is null and node2's left is not null, then add node1's left to node2's left
            if (node1->left == NULL && node2->left != NULL)
                node1->left = node2->left;
            else if (node1->left && node2->left) // if both's left not null then push them in respective queues
                q1.push(node1->left), q2.push(node2->left);

            // if node1's right is null and node2's right is not null, then add node1's right to node2's right
            if (node1->right == NULL && node2->right != NULL)
                node1->right = node2->right;
            else if (node1->right && node2->right) // if both's right not null then push them in respective queues
                q1.push(node1->right), q2.push(node2->right);
        }
        return t1;
    }
};
