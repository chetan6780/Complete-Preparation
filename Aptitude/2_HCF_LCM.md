# HCF and LCM

1. Find Factors
2. - `6n+1` - After 3 prime numbers every prime number follows this property.
   - A] 12,18
3. A] 32
4. A] 37
5. - `2 - 90` : check divisibility by `3` only;
   - `90 - 121` : check divisibility by `3` and `7` only;
   - `121 - 200` : check divisibility by `3`, `7` and `11` only;
6. C] 101
7. A] 127
8. - `HCF(a, b, c)` = All common factors with their `lowest` avalable power.
   - `LCM(a, b, c)` = All common factors with their `highest` avalable power.
9. C] 2
10. C] 9
11. C] `3*X^2*Y^2*Z`
12. - if 2 numbers are `(X, X+Y)` then their HCF will be multiple of `Y`
    - if `Y` is prime then HCF will be `Y`
13. B] 4
14. D] 2
15. E] NA
16. D] 2
17. D] 34
18. D] 2l
19. `HCF[(X+Y),(X+Y)+Z]` == `HCF(Y,Z)`
20. D] 26
21. C] 30
22. B] 26
23. - LCM of coprime numbers is their multiplication itself.
    - 3 numbers are coprime if (a,b), (b,c) and (a,c) are coprime.
    - ex. 42,44,18,25 --> 7\*11\*2\*18\*25 --> 18 and 25 are coprime.
    - **LCM has to be multiple of HCF.**
    - X\*Y = LCM\*HCF
    - LCM of factors like `(1/2,5/7,8/3)` is `LCM of Numerator / HCF of denominator`
    - NOTE: Factors should be in their least form.
    - HCF of factors like `(1/2,5/7,8/3)` is `HCF of Numerator / LCM of denominator`
24. C] 12
25. A] 17\*3\*5\*7^2
26. B] 2\*3^3\*5
27. `HCF*LCM == A*B` && `HCF%LCM==0`
28. A] x+1
29. A] 273,357
30. B] 12:48 PM
