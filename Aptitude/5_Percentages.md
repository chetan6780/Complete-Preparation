1. **Unity Method :** two variables are moving linearly with respect to each other.
2. A] 6/25
3. B] 43%
4. D] None of these
5. Read problem carefully.
6. A] 60
7. B] 50

9. 5.7kmph
10. Product Change situations, `if x and y changes 20 and 30 per respectively what is final change in the multiplication`![pcs](/assets/pcs.png)
11. 56%
12. 171.6 None
13. Problems on product change.
    ```
    - change in area of rectangle (a*b = area)
    - change in volume of cuboid (a*b*c = volume)
    - Revenue generation (unit*selling price = revenue)
    - change in distance travelled (speed*time = distance)
    - All other properties where multiplication is involved.
    ```
14. B] 1% decrease
15. PCG - Product constancy application `Ex. price up by 25% how much should be consumption in percentage to get constant revenue`![pcg-pca](/assets/pcg-pca.png)
    ```
       - constant area of rectangle (a*b = area)
       - constant volume of cuboid (a*b*c = volume)
       - constant Revenue generation (unit*selling price = revenue)
       - constant distance travelled (speed*time = distance)
       - All other properties where multiplication is involved.
    ```

17. Fractional view of PCT. #above img.
    - Generic formula `if x increase by y/a it will decrease by y/(a+y)`
18. Problems on PC - same as 13 and 15.
    - New Exception is `targeted change`, eg `limit increase in area of triangle by 60% if l is 40% increasing what change in b.` ans is `14.28`
19. B] 25%
20. c] 25 ???
21. Successive percentage change - only difference with PCG is we **Can't interchange the arrows here**.
