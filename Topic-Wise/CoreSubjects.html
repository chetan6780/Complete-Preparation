<h3><strong>Operating System</strong>:</h3>
<details>
    <summary>
        What is the main purpose of an operating system? Discuss different
        types?
    </summary>
    <p>
        An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer
        hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer
        programs. So it manages the computer&#8217;s memory, processes, devices,
        files, and security aspects of the system. It also allows us to
        communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the
        computer&#8217;s language. Without an operating system, a computer is
        not useful.
    </p>
    <p>Types of operating system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Batch OS</li>
        <li>Distributed OS</li>
        <li>Multitasking OS</li>
        <li>Network OS</li>
        <li>Real-Time OS</li>
        <li>Mobile OS</li>

    <summary>What is a socket, kernel and monolithic kernel ?</summary>
    <p>
        Socket:<br />A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication, A
        pair of processes communicating over a network employ a pair of sockets
        ,one for each process. A socket is identified by an IP address
        concatenated with a port number.<br />The server waits for incoming
        client requests by listening to a specified port. Once a request is
        received, the server accepts a connection from the client socket to
        complete the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kernel is the central core component of an operating system that manages
        operations of computer and hardware. Kernel Establishes communication
        between user level application and hardware. Manages memory and CPU
        time. Decides state of incoming processes. Controls Disk, Memory, Task
        Management
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Monolithic Kernel</b> (provides good performance but lots of lines of
        code)<br />It is one of the types of kernel where all operating system
        services operate in kernel space. It has dependencies between system
        components. It has huge lines of code which is complex.<br />Example :
        Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400 etc.

    <summary>
        Difference between process and program and thread? Different types of
        process.
    </summary>
    <p>
        <b>Process:</b><br />Process is an instance of an executing program. For
        example, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we
        execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks
        mentioned in the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Program:</b><br />Program is a set of instructions to perform a
        certain task. Eg: chrome.exe, notepad.exe
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Thread:</b><br />Thread is a path of execution within a process. A
        thread is also known as a lightweight process. The idea is to achieve
        parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For
        example,Word processor uses multiple threads: one thread to format the
        text, another thread to process inputs.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Define virtual memory, thrashing, threads.</summary>
    <p>
        <b>Virtual Memory:</b><br />A computer can address more memory than the
        amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually
        called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard disk that&#8217;s
        set up to emulate the computer&#8217;s RAM.<br />The main visible
        advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical
        memory. Virtual memory serves two purposes. First, it allows us to
        extend the use of physical memory by using a disk. Second, it allows us
        to have memory protection, because each virtual address is translated to
        a physical address.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Thrashing: </b><br />Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the
        system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page
        faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible. High degree
        of multiprogramming(if number of processes keeps on increasing in the
        memory), lack of frames (if a process is allocated too few frames, then
        there will be too many and too frequent page faults) causes Thrashing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Threads:</b><br />A thread is a single sequential flow of execution
        of tasks of a process so it is also known as thread of execution or
        thread of control.
    </p>

    <summary>What is RAID ? Different types.</summary>
    <p>
        RAID, or “Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks” is a technique which
        makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a single
        disk for increased performance, data redundancy or both.Data redundancy,
        although taking up extra space, adds to disk reliability. This means, in
        case of disk failure, if the same data is also backed up onto another
        disk, we can retrieve the data and go on with the operation.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        What is a deadlock? Different conditions to achieve a deadlock.
    </summary>
    <p>
        A Deadlock is a situation where each of the computer processes waits for
        a resource which is being assigned to some other process. In this
        situation, none of the processes gets executed since the resource it
        needs is held by some other process which is also waiting for some other
        resource to be released.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How deadlock is achieved: </b>
        Deadlock happens when Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, No preemption and
        circular wait occurs simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>Necessary Conditions for deadlock:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mutual Exclusion</li>
        <li>Hold and Wait</li>
        <li>No preemption</li>
        <li>Circular Wait</li>
    </ol>

    <summary>What is fragmentation? Types of fragmentation.</summary>
    <p>
        <b>Fragmentation:</b><br />An unwanted problem in the operating system
        in which the processes are loaded and unloaded from memory, and free
        memory space is fragmented. Processes can&#8217;t be assigned to memory
        blocks due to their small size, and the memory blocks stay unused. It is
        also necessary to understand that as programs are loaded and deleted
        from memory, they generate free space or a hole in the memory. These
        small blocks cannot be allotted to new arriving processes, resulting in
        inefficient memory use.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conditions of fragmentation depend on the memory allocation system.
        As the process is loaded and unloaded from memory, these areas are
        fragmented into small pieces of memory that cannot be allocated to
        incoming processes. It is called fragmentation.
    </p>
    <p>Types of fragmentation:<br />1. Internal<br />2. External</p>

    <summary>What is spooling ?</summary>
    <p>
        SPOOL is an acronym for simultaneous peripheral operations online.
        Spooling is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and
        executed by a device, program, or system.<br />In spooling, there is no
        interaction between the I/O devices and the CPU. That means there is no
        need for the CPU to wait for the I/O operations to take place. Such
        operations take a long time to finish executing, so the CPU will not
        wait for them to finish.<br />The biggest example of Spooling is
        printing. The documents which are to be printed are stored in the SPOOL
        and then added to the queue for printing. During this time, many
        processes can perform their operations and use the CPU without waiting
        while the printer executes the printing process on the documents
        one-by-one.

    <summary>Belady’s Anomaly</summary>
    <p>
        Bélády’s anomaly is the name given to the phenomenon where increasing
        the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page
        faults for a given memory access pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution to fix Belady’s Anomaly:</b><br />Implementing alternative
        page replacement algo helps eliminate Belady’s Anomaly.. Use of stack
        based algorithms, such as Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm and Least
        Recently Used (LRU) algorithm, can eliminate the issue of increased page
        faults as these algorithms assign priority to pages
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Starving and Aging in OS</summary>
    <p>
        Starving/Starvation(also called Lived lock): Starvation is the problem
        that occurs when low priority processes get jammed for an unspecified
        time as the high priority processes keep executing. So starvation
        happens if a method is indefinitely delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Solution to Starvation : Ageing is a technique of gradually increasing
        the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Why does trashing occur?</summary>
    <p>
        High degree of multiprogramming(if number of processes keeps on
        increasing in the memory) , lack of frames(if a process is allocated too
        few frames, then there will be too many and too frequent page faults.)
        causes Thrashing.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What is paging and why do we need it?</summary>
    <p>
        Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for
        contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the
        physical address space of a process to be non – contiguous.<br />Paging
        is used for faster access to data. When a program needs a page, it is
        available in the main memory(RAM) as the OS copies a certain number of
        pages from your storage device to main memory. Paging allows the
        physical address space of a process to be noncontiguous.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Demand Paging, Segmentation</summary>
    <p>
        Demand paging is a method of virtual memory management which is based on
        the principle that pages should only be brought into memory if the
        executing process demands them. This is often referred to as lazy
        evaluation as only those pages demanded by the process are swapped from
        secondary storage to main memory.<br />So demand paging works opposite
        to the principle of loading all pages immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        Segmentation is a memory management technique in which the memory is
        divided into the variable size parts. Each part is known as a segment
        which can be allocated to a process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The details about each segment are stored in a table called a segment
        table. Segment table is stored in one (or many) of the segments.
    </p>
    <p>Segment table contains mainly two information about segment:</p>
    <p>
        Base: It is the base address of the segment<br />Limit: It is the length
        of the segment.

    <summary>Real Time Operating System, types of RTOS.</summary>
    <p>
        A real-time operating system (RTOS) is a special-purpose operating
        system used in computers that has strict time constraints for any job to
        be performed and is intended to serve real time applications that
        possess data as it comes in , typically without buffer delays.
    </p>
    <p>Types of RTOS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hard RTOS</li>
        <li>Firm RTOS</li>

    <summary>Dynamic Binding</summary>
    <p>
        Static binding happens when the code is compiled, while dynamic bind
        happens when the code is executed at run time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Static Binding:</b><br />When a compiler acknowledges all the
        information required to call a function or all the values of the
        variables during compile time, it is called “static binding”. As all the
        required information is known before runtime, it increases the program
        efficiency and it also enhances the speed of execution of a program.
        Static Binding makes a program very efficient, but it declines the
        program flexibility, as ‘values of variable’ and ‘function calling’ are
        predefined in the program. Static binding is implemented in a program at
        the time of coding. Overloading a function or an operator is the example
        of compile time polymorphism i.e. static binding.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Dynamic Binding</b> Calling a function or assigning a value to a
        variable, at run-time is called “Dynamic Binding”. Dynamic binding can
        be associated with run time ‘polymorphism’ and ‘inheritance’ in OOP.
        Dynamic binding makes the execution of a program flexible as it can
        decide what value should be assigned to the variable and which function
        should be called, at the time of program execution. But as this
        information is provided at run time it makes the execution slower as
        compared to static binding.

<details>
    <summary>SJF Scheduling</summary>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>SRTF Scheduling</summary>
    <p>
        SRTF Scheduling is a preemptive version of SJF scheduling. In SRTF, the
        execution of the process can be stopped after a certain amount of time.
        At the arrival of every process, the short term scheduler schedules the
        process with the least remaining burst time among the list of available
        processes and the running process.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>LRTF Scheduling</summary>
    <p>
        This is a preemptive version of Longest Job First (LJF) scheduling
        algorithm. In this scheduling algorithm, we find the process with the
        maximum remaining time and then process it. We check for the maximum
        remaining time after some interval of time(say 1 unit each) to check if
        another process having more Burst Time arrived up to that time.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Priority Scheduling</summary>
    <p>
        Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on
        priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as
        per the priority.
    </p>
    <p>
        The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas
        jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS
        basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements,
        etc.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Round Robin Scheduling</summary>
    <p>
        In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a
        cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm also offers
        starvation free execution of processes. Widely used preemptive
        scheduling method in traditional OS. All the jobs get a fair allocation
        of CPU. Cons include : Finding a correct time quantum is a quite
        difficult task in this system, Round-robin scheduling doesn’t give
        special priority to more important tasks.

    <summary>Producer Consumer Problem</summary>
    <p>
        About Producer-Consumer problem: The Producer-Consumer problem is a
        classic problem that is used for multi-process synchronisation i.e.
        synchronisation between more than one processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The job of the Producer is to generate the data, put it into the buffer,
        and again start generating data. While the job of the Consumer is to
        consume the data from the buffer.
    </p>
    <p>
        What&#8217;s the problem here?<br />The following are the problems that
        might occur in the Producer-Consumer:
    </p>
    <p>
        The producer should produce data only when the buffer is not full. If
        the buffer is full, then the producer shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to put
        any data into the buffer.<br />The consumer should consume data only
        when the buffer is not empty. If the buffer is empty, then the consumer
        shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to take any data from the buffer.<br />The
        producer and consumer should not access the buffer at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>We can solve this problem by using semaphores.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Banker’s Algorithm</summary>
    <p>
        It is a banker algorithm used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources
        safely to each process in the computer system. The &#8216;S-State&#8217;
        examines all possible tests or activities before deciding whether the
        allocation should be allowed to each process. It also helps the
        operating system to successfully share the resources between all the
        processes. The banker&#8217;s algorithm is named because it checks
        whether a person should be sanctioned a loan amount or not to help the
        bank system safely simulate allocation resources.
    </p>

    <summary>Explain Cache</summary>
    <p>
        Cache memory is an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer
        between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and
        instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when
        needed.

    <summary>What is DBMS ? Mention advantages..</summary>
    <p>
        Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and
        retrieving users&#8217; data while considering appropriate security
        measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the
        database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and
        instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large
        systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and
        retrieve data.

    <summary>Difference between vertical and horizontal scaling</summary>
    <p>
        Scaling alters the size of a system. In the scaling process, we either
        compress or expand the system to meet the expected needs. The scaling
        operation can be achieved by adding resources to meet the smaller
        expectation in the current system, or by adding a new system in the
        existing one, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vertical scaling keeps your existing infrastructure but adds computing
        power. Your existing pool of code does not need to change — you simply
        need to run the same code on machines with better specs. By scaling up,
        you increase the capacity of a single machine and increase its
        throughput. Vertical scaling allows data to live on a single node, and
        scaling spreads the load through CPU and RAM resources for your
        machines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Horizontal scaling simply adds more instances of machines without first
        implementing improvements to existing specifications. By scaling out,
        you share the processing power and load balancing across multiple
        machines.

    <summary>What is sharding</summary>
    <p>
        Sharding is a method of splitting and storing a single logical dataset
        in multiple databases. By distributing the data among multiple machines,
        a cluster of database systems can store larger dataset and handle
        additional requests. Sharding is necessary if a dataset is too large to
        be stored in a single database. Moreover, many sharding strategies allow
        additional machines to be added. Sharding allows a database cluster to
        scale along with its data and traffic growth.

    <summary>Keys in DBMS</summary>
    <p>
        A key is a set of attributes that can identify each tuple uniquely in
        the given relation.
    </p>
    <p>Types of Keys:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Super Key</b> &#8211; A superkey is a set of attributes that can
            identify each tuple uniquely in the given relation. A super key may
            consist of any number of attributes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Candidate Key</b> &#8211; A set of minimal attribute(s) that can
            identify each tuple uniquely in the given relation is called a
            candidate key.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Primary Key</b> &#8211; A primary key is a candidate key that the
            database designer selects while designing the database. Primary Keys
            are unique and NOT NULL.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Alternate Key</b> &#8211; Candidate keys that are left
            unimplemented or unused after implementing the primary key are
            called alternate keys.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Foreign Key</b> &#8211; An attribute ‘X’ is called as a foreign
            key to some other attribute ‘Y’ when its values are dependent on the
            values of attribute ‘Y’. The relation in which attribute ‘Y’ is
            present is called the referenced relation. The relation in which
            attribute ‘X’ is present is called the referencing relation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Composite Key</b> &#8211; A primary key composed of multiple
            attributes and not just a single attribute is called a composite
            key.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Unique Key</b> &#8211; It is unique for all the records of the
            table. Once assigned, its value cannot be changed i.e. it is
            non-updatable. It may have a NULL value.

    <summary>Data abstraction in DBMS, three levels of it</summary>
    <p>
        Data Abstraction is a process of hiding unwanted or irrelevant details
        from the end user. It provides a different view and helps in achieving
        data independence which is used to enhance the security of data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Database systems include complex data-structures. In terms of retrieval
        of data, reduce complexity in terms of usability of users and in order
        to make the system efficient, developers use levels of abstraction that
        hide irrelevant details from the users. Levels of abstraction simplify
        database design.

        DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is used to define database
        structure or pattern.<br />It is used to create schema, tables, indexes,
        constraints, etc. in the database.<br />Using the DDL statements, you
        can create the skeleton of the database.<br />Data definition language
        is used to store the information of metadata like the number of tables

    <summary>What is normalization ? Types of normalization.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Normalization is the process of organizing data by disintegrating
            bigger table into smaller one’s<br />with proper dependencies
        </li>
        <li>
            Redundant Data wastes a lot of disk space and creates maintenance
            problems (Update, Insert and Delete Anomaly). Hence the DB tables
            should be Normalized.
        </li>
        <li>
            The process of Normalization is achieved by following some rules
            which are defined as Normal Forms
        </li>
        <li>
            There are basically 3 types of Normal Form – 1NF, 2NF, 3NF.
            Strictness increases as we go from 1NF to 3NF.
        </li>
        <li>
            Apart from the above mentioned Normal Form there exist one more Form
            called Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF) . This is an advanced version
            of 3NF and is even stricter than 3NF.

    <p>
        Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add
        redundant data to one or more tables. This can help us avoid costly
        joins in a relational database. Note that denormalization does not mean
        not doing normalisation. It is an optimization technique that is applied
        after doing normalisation.

    <summary>What is functional dependency ?</summary>
    <p>
        A functional dependency is a constraint that specifies the relationship
        between two sets of attributes where one set can accurately determine
        the value of other sets. It is denoted as X → Y, where X is a set of
        attributes that is capable of determining the value of Y. The attribute
        set on the left side of the arrow, X is called Determinant, while on the
        right side, Y is called the Dependent.

        relationship for a specified system.
    </p>
    <p>
        It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also develops a
        very simple and easy to design view of data.<br />In ER modelling, the
        database structure is portrayed as a diagram called an
        entity-relationship diagram.

    <summary>Conflict Serializability in DBMS ..</summary>
    <p>
        Serializability is a concept that helps us to check which schedules are
        serializable. A serializable schedule is the one that always leaves the
        database in consistent state.
    </p>
    <p>
        A schedule is called conflict serializability if after swapping of
        non-conflicting operations, it can transform into a serial schedule. The
        schedule will be a conflict serializable if it is conflict equivalent to
        a serial schedule.

    <summary>What is CCP ? (Concurrency Control Protocols)</summary>
    <p>
        Concurrency Control is the management procedure that is required for
        controlling concurrent execution of the operations that take place on a
        database.
    </p>
    <p>
        The concurrency control protocols ensure the atomicity, consistency,
        isolation, durability and serializability of the concurrent execution of
        the database transactions.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, these protocols are categorised as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lock Based Concurrency Control Protocol</li>

    <summary>Entity, Entity Type, Entity Set, Weak Entity Set..</summary>
    <p>
        Entity in DBMS can be a real-world object with an existence, For
        example, in a College database, the entities can be Professor, Students,
        Courses, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The entity type is a collection of the entity having similar attributes.
    </p>
    <p>Types of Entity type:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Strong Entity Type</b>:Strong entities are those entity types
            which have a key attribute. The primary key helps in identifying
            each entity uniquely. It is represented by a rectangle.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Weak Entity Type</b>: Weak entity type doesn&#8217;t have a key
            attribute. Weak entity types can&#8217;t be identified on their own.
            It depends upon some other strong entity for its distinct identity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Entity Set: </b>Entity Set is a collection of entities of the
            same entity type. We can say that entity type is a superset of the
            entity set as all the entities are included in the entity type.

    <summary>Explain TCP model ..&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        It is a compressed version of the OSI model with only 4 layers. It was
        developed by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the 1860s. The name
        of this model is based on 2 standard protocols used i.e. TCP
        (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Network Access/Link layer : Decides which links such as serial lines
        or classic Ethernet must be used<br />
        to meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer. Ex &#8211;
        Sonet, Ethernet<br />
        2. Internet : The internet layer is the most important layer which holds
        the whole<br />
        architecture together. It delivers the IP packets where they are
        supposed to be<br />
        delivered. Ex &#8211; IP, ICMP.<br />
        3. Transport : Its functionality is almost the same as the OSI transport
        layer. It<br />
        enables peer entities on the network to carry on a conversation. Ex
        &#8211; TCP, UDP<br />
        (User Datagram Protocol)<br />
        4. Application : It contains all the higher-level protocols. Ex &#8211;

    <summary>Significance of Data Link Layer</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It is used for transferring the data from one node to another node.
        </li>
        <li>
            It receives the data from the network layer and converts the data
            into data frames and then attaches the physical address to these
            frames which are sent to the physical layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            It enables the error-free transfer of data from one node to another
            node.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Functions of Data-link layer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Frame synchronisation: Data-link layer converts the data into
            frames, and it ensures that the destination must recognize the
            starting and ending of each frame.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flow control: Data-link layer controls the data flow within the
            network.
        </li>
        <li>
            Error control: It detects and corrects the error occurred during the
            transmission from source to destination.
        </li>
        <li>
            Addressing: Data-link layers attach the physical address with the
            data frames so that the individual machines can be easily
            identified.
        </li>
        <li>
            Link management: Data-link layer manages the initiation, maintenance
            and termination of the link between the source and destination for
            the effective exchange of data.

    </summary>
    <p>
        A node that is connected to two or more networks is commonly known as a
        gateway. It is also known as a router. It is used to forward messages
        from one network to another. Both the gateway and router regulate the
        traffic in the network. Differences between gateway and router: A router
        sends the data between two similar networks while gateway sends the data
        between two dissimilar networks.

        introduced by Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel in 1983.<br />
        2. It is a naming system for all the resources over the internet which
        includes physical nodes and applications. It is used to locate resources
        easily over a network.<br />
        3. DNS is an internet which maps the domain names to their associated IP
        addresses.<br />
        4. Without DNS, users must know the IP address of the web page that you
        wanted to access.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>DNS Forwarder :</b> A forwarder is used with a DNS server when it
        receives DNS queries that cannot be resolved quickly. So it forwards
        those requests to external DNS servers for resolution. A DNS server
        which is configured as a forwarder will behave differently than the DNS
        server which is not configured as a forwarder. NIC stands for Network
        Interface Card. It is a peripheral card attached to the PC to connect to
        a network. Every NIC has its own MAC address that identifies the PC on
        the network. It provides a wireless connection to a local area network.
        NICs were mainly used in desktop computers.

    <summary>What is MAC address ?&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier
        assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network
        address in communications within a network segment.

        What is IP address, private IP address, public IP address, APIPA ?&nbsp;
    </summary>
    <p>
        An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the
        internet or a local network. IP stands for &#8220;Internet
        Protocol,&#8221; which is the set of rules governing the format of data
        sent via the internet or local network.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Private IP Address</b> &#8211; There are three ranges of IP addresses
        that have been reserved<br />
        for IP addresses. They are not valid for use on the internet. If you
        want to access the<br />
        internet on these private IPs, you must use a proxy server or NAT
        server.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Public IP Address</b> &#8211; A public IP address is an address taken
        by the Internet Service<br />
        Provider which facilitates communication on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>APIPA stands for Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)</b>. It is a
        feature or characteristic in operating systems (eg. Windows) which
        enables computers to self-configure an IP address and subnet mask
        automatically when their DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:A DHCP
        Server is a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP
        addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client
        devices. It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host

    <summary>What is subnet ?&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        A subnet is a network inside a network achieved by the process called
        subnetting which helps divide a network into subnets. It is used for
        getting a higher routing efficiency and enhances the security of the
        network. It reduces the time to extract the host address from the
        routing table.

    <summary>Firewalls&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        The firewall is a network security system that is used to monitor the
        incoming<br />
        and outgoing traffic and blocks the same based on the firewall security
        policies. It acts as a wall between the internet (public network) and
        the networking devices (a private network). It is either a hardware
        device, software program, or a combination of both. It adds a layer of
        security to the network.

    <summary>Different type of delays&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        The delays, here, means the time for which the processing of a
        particular packet takes place.
    </p>
    <p>We have the following types of delays in computer networks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transmission Delay</li>
        <li>Propagation delay</li>
        <li>Queueing delay</li>

    <summary>3 way handshaking&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        Three-Way HandShake or a TCP 3-way handshake is a process which is used
        in a TCP/IP network to make a connection between the server and client.
        It is a three-step process that requires both the client and server to
        exchange synchronisation and acknowledgment packets before the real data
        communication process starts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three-way handshake process is designed in such a way that both ends
        help you to initiate, negotiate, and separate TCP socket connections at
        the same time. It allows you to transfer multiple TCP socket connections
        in both directions at the same time.

    <summary>Server-side load balancer</summary>
    <p>
        All backend server instances are registered with a central load
        balancer. A client requests this load balancer which then routes the
        request to one of the server instances using various algorithms like
        round-robin. AWS ELB(Elastic Load Balancing) is a prime example of
        server-side load-balancing that registers multiple EC2 instances
        launched in its auto-scaling group and then routes the client requests
        to one of the EC2 instances.
    </p>
    <p>Advantages of server-side load balancing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Simple client configuration: only need to know the load-balancer
            address.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clients can be untrusted: all traffic goes through the load-balancer
            where it can be looked at. Clients are not aware of the backend
            servers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <summary>RSA Algorithm&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric
        actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and
        Private Key. As the name describes, the Public Key is given to everyone
        and the Private key is kept private.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of asymmetric cryptography : A client (for example browser)
        sends its public key to the server and requests for some data. The
        server encrypts the data using the client&#8217;s public key and sends
        the encrypted data. Client receives this data and decrypts it. Since
        this is asymmetric, nobody else except the browser can decrypt the data
        even if a third party has the public key of the browser.

    <summary>What is HTTP and HTTPS protocol ?&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules
        and standards on how the information can be transmitted on the World
        Wide Web (WWW). It helps the web browsers and web servers for
        communication. It is a ‘stateless protocol’ where each command is
        independent with respect to the previous command. HTTP is an application
        layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by default. HTTPS is
        the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure or Secure HTTP. It is an advanced
        and a secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS protocol is used
        to provide security. It enables secure transactions by encrypting the
        communication and also helps identify network servers securely. It uses
        port 443 by default.

    <summary>What is SMTP protocol ?&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP sets the rule for
        communication between servers. This set of rules helps the software to
        transmit emails over the internet. It supports both End-to-End and
        Store-and-Forward methods. It is in always-listening mode on port 25.

    <summary>TCP and UDP protocol, prepare differences</summary>
    <p>
        TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless
        protocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is
        comparatively slower than UDP. Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler,
        and<br />
        efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only
        possible with TCP.
    </p>
    <p>
        TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it
        provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. UDP has only the basic
        error checking mechanism using checksums.

        <li>
            If not, the browser checks if the IP of the URL is present in the
            cache (browser and OS) if not then requests the OS to do a DNS
            lookup using UDP to get the corresponding IP address of the URL from
            the DNS server to establish a new TCP connection.
        </li>
        <li>
            A new TCP connection is set between the browser and the server using

    <summary>VPN, advantages and disadvantages of it&nbsp;</summary>
    <p>
        VPN (Virtual Private Network) : VPN or the Virtual Private Network is a
        private WAN<br />
        (Wide Area Network) built on the internet. It allows the creation of a
        secured tunnel<br />
        (protected network) between different networks using the internet
        (public network). By using the VPN, a client can connect to the
        organisation’s network remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Advantages of VPN :<br />
        1. VPN is used to connect offices in different geographical locations
        remotely and is<br />
        cheaper when compared to WAN connections.<br />
        2. VPN is used for secure transactions and confidential data transfer
        between<br />
        multiple offices located in different geographical locations.<br />
        3. VPN keeps an organisation’s information secured against any potential
        threats or<br />
        intrusions by using virtualization.<br />
        4. VPN encrypts the internet traffic and disguises the online identity
    </p>
    <p>
        Disadvantages of VPN :<br />
        1. Not designed for continuous use<br />
        2. Complexity prevents scalability<br />
        3. Lack of granular security<br />
